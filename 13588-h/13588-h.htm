<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
<p><i>As the design of Learning is to render persons agreeable
companions to themselves, and useful members of society; to support
solitude with pleasure, and to pass through promiscuous temptations
with prudence; 'tis presumed, this compilation will not be
unacceptable; being composed of pieces selected from the most
celebrated moral writers in the English language, equally
calculated to promote the principles of religion, and to render
youth vigilant in discharging, the social and relative duties in
the several stations of life; by instilling into their minds such
maxims of virtue and good-breeding, as tend to eradicate local
prejudices and rusticity of manners; and at the same time,
habituate them to an elegant manner of expressing themselves either
in Writing or Speaking.</i></p>
<p><i>And as the first impression made on the minds of youth is the
most lasting, great care should be taken to furnish them with such
seeds of reason and philosophy as may rectify and sweeten every
part of their future lives; by marking out a proper behaviour both
with respect to themselves and others, and exhibiting every virtue
to their view which claims their attention, and every vice which
they ought to avoid. Instead of this, we generally see youth
suffered to read romances, which impress on their minds such
notions of Fairies, Goblins, &amp;c. that exist only in the
imagination, and, being strongly imbibed, take much time to
eradicate, and very often baffle all the powers of philosophy. If
books abounding with moral instructions, conveyed in a proper
manner, were given in their stead, the frequent reading of them
would implant in their mind such ideas and sentiments, as would
enable them to guard against those prejudices so frequently met
with amongst the ignorant.</i></p>
<p><i>Nor is it possible that any person can speak or write with
elegance and propriety, who has not been taught to read well, and
in such books where the sentiments are just and the language
pure.</i></p>
<p><i>An insipid flatness and languor is almost the universal fault
in reading; often uttering their words so faint and feeble, that
they appear neither to feel nor understand what they read, nor have
any desire it should be understood or felt by others. In order to
acquire a forcible manner of pronouncing words, let the pupils
inure themselves, while reading, to draw in as much air as their
lungs can contain with ease, and to expel it with vehemence in
uttering those sounds which require an emphatical pronunciation,
and read aloud with all the exertion they can command; let all the
consonant sounds be expressed with a full impulse of the breath,
and a forcible action of the organs employed in forming them; and
all the vowel sounds have a full and bold utterance.</i></p>
<p><i>These reasons, and to inspire youth with noble sentiments,
just expression, to ease the teacher, and to render a book cheap,
and convenient for schools, as well as private persons, who have
neither time nor opportunity to peruse the works of those
celebrated authors from whence this Collection is made, was the
cause of the following compilation.</i></p>
<p><i>And as the speeches in both houses of parliament, pleading at
the bar, instructions in the pulpit, and commercial correspondance,
are delivered and carried on in the English language; the cloathing
our thoughts with proper expressions, and conveying our ideas,
either in writing or speaking, agreeably, cannot fail of making an
impression upon the hearer or reader. For a man's knowledge is of
little use to the world, when he is not able to convey it properly
to others; which is the case of many who are endowed with excellent
parts, but are either afraid or ashamed of writing, or speaking in
public, being conscious of their own deficiency of expressing
themselves in proper terms.</i></p>
<p><i>In order to remedy these defects, and to ease the teacher, I
would advise, that several young gentlemen read in a class, each a
sentence in this book, (it being divided into small portions for
that purpose,) as often as convenient: and let him who reads best,
be advanced to the head, or have some pecuniary reward; and every
inferior one according to his merit; this will create emulation
among them, and facilitate their improvement much more than threats
or corrections, which stupifies and intimidates them, and often
ends in contempt of their teachers, and learning in general. This
will draw forth those latent abilities, which otherwise might lie
dormant forever.</i></p>
<p><i>It may not be improper for the teacher, or some good reader,
to read a sentence or two first, that the learners may gain the
proper emphasis, and read without that monotony so painful to a
good ear: for they will improve more by imitating a good reader,
than any rules that can be laid down to them. When they come to
read gracefully, let them stand up in the school and read aloud, in
order to take off that bashfulness generally attending those who
are called upon either to read or speak in public.</i></p>
<p><i>The next thing I would recommend, is the English Grammar (the
best I know of is the Buchanan's syntax) the knowledge of which is
absolutely necessary, as it is the solid foundation upon which all
other science rests. After they have run over the rules of syntax,
the teacher may dictate to them one or more sentences in false
English, which they may correct by their grammar rules, and also
find out the various significations of each word in the dictionary;
by which means they will soon acquire a copious vocabulary, and
become acquainted not with words only, but with things themselves.
Let them get those sentences by heart to speak extempore; which
will in some measure, be delivering their own compositions, and may
be repeated as often as convenient. This will soon give the young
gentlemen an idea of the force, elegance, and beauty of the English
language.</i></p>
<p><i>The next thing I would gladly recommend, is that of
letter-writing, a branch of education, which seems to me of the
utmost utility, and in which most of our youth are deficient at
their leaving school; being suffered to form their own style by
chance: or imitate the first wretched model that falls in their
way, before they know what is faulty, or can relish the beauties of
a just simplicity.</i></p>
<p><i>For their improvement in this particular, the teacher may
cause every young gentleman to have a slate or paper before him, on
Saturdays, and then dictate a letter to them, either of his own
composition, or taken out of some book, and turn it into false
English, to exercise them in the grammar rules if he thinks proper,
which they shall all write down, and then correct and transcribe it
fairly in their books.</i></p>
<p><i>After the young gentlemen have been accustomed to this some
time, a supposed correspondence may be fixt between every two of
them, and write to one another under the inspection of the teacher
who may correct and shew their faults when he sees occasion; by
such a method he will soon find them improve in epistolary writing.
The same may be observed with regard to young ladies, who are very
often deficient, not only in orthography, but every other part of
grammar.</i></p>
<p><i>If something similar to this method be pursued, it will soon
reflect honor on the teacher, give the highest satisfaction to
judicious parents, and entail upon the scholar a pleasing and
lasting advantage.</i></p>

<h2><i>Pursuit of Knowledge recommended to Youth</i>.</h2>
<p><b>1.</b> I am very much concerned when I see young gentlemen of
fortune and quality so wholly set upon pleasure and diversions,
that they neglect all those improvements in wisdom and knowledge
which may make them easy to themselves and useful to the world. The
greatest part of our <i>British</i> youth lose their figure, and
grow out of fashion, by that time they are five and twenty.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> As soon as the natural gaiety and amiableness of the
young man wears off, they have nothing left to recommend them, but
<i>lie by</i> the rest of their lives, among the lumber and refuse
of the species.</p>
<p>It sometimes happens, indeed, that for want of applying
themselves in due time to the pursuits of knowledge, they take up a
book in their declining years, and grow very hopeful scholars by
that time they are threescore. I must therefore earnestly press my
readers who are in the flower of their youth, to labour at these
accomplishments which may set off their persons when their bloom is
gone, and to <i>lay in</i> timely provisions for manhood and old
age. In short, I would advise the youth of fifteen to be dressing
up every day the man of fifty; or to consider how to make himself
venerable at threescore.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> Young men, who are naturally ambitious, would do well
to observe how the greatest men of antiquity wade it their ambition
to excel all their cotemporaries in knowledge. <i>Julius
C&aelig;sar</i> and <i>Alexander</i>, the most celebrated instances
of human greatness, took a particular care to distinguish
themselves by their skill in the arts and sciences. We have still
extant, several remains of the former, which justify the character
given of him by the learned men of his own age.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> As for the latter, it is a known saying of his, that
he was more obliged to <i>Aristotle</i>, who had instructed him,
than to <i>Philip</i>, who had given him life and empire. There is
a letter of his recorded by <i>Plutarch</i> and <i>Aulus
Gellius</i>, which he wrote to <i>Aristotle</i>, upon hearing that
he had published those lectures he had given him in private. This
letter was written in the following words, at a time when he was in
the height of his <i>Persian</i> conquests.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> "ALEXANDER <i>to</i> ARISTOTLE, <i>Greeting</i>.</p>
<p>"You have not done well to publish your books of select
knowledge; for what is there now in which I can surpass others, if
those things which I have been instructed in are communicated to
every body? For my own part I declare to you, I would rather excel
others in knowledge than power. <i>Farewell</i>."</p>
<p><b>6.</b> We see by this letter, that the love of conquest was
but the second ambition in <i>Alexander</i>'s soul. Knowledge is
indeed that, which, next to virtue, truly and essentially raises
one man above another. It finishes one half of the human soul. It
makes being pleasant to us, fills the mind with entertaining views,
and administers to it a perpetual series of gratifications.</p>
<p>It gives ease to solitude, and gracefulness to retirement. It
fills a public station with suitable abilities, and adds a lustre
to those who are in possession of them.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> Learning, by which I mean all useful knowledge,
whether speculative or practical, is in popular and mixed
governments the natural source of wealth and honor. If we look into
most of the reigns from the conquest, we shall find, that the
favorites of each reign have been those who have raised themselves.
The greatest men are generally the growth of that particular age in
which they flourish.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> A superior capacity for business and a more extensive
knowledge, are the steps by which a new man often mounts to favor,
and outshines the rest of his cotemporaries. But when men are
actually born to titles, it is almost impossible that they should
fail of receiving an additional greatness, if they take care to
accomplish themselves for it.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> The story of <i>Solomon</i>'s choice, does not only
instruct us in that point of history, but furnishes out a very fine
moral to us, namely, that he who applies his heart to wisdom, does
at the same time take the most proper method for gaining long life,
riches and reputation, which are very often not only the rewards,
but the effects of wisdom.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> As it is very suitable to my present subject, I shall
first of all quote this passage in the words of sacred writ, and
afterwards mention an allegory, in which this whole passage is
represented by a famous FRENCH Poet; not questioning but it will be
very pleasing to such of my readers as have a taste for fine
writing.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> In <i>Gibeon</i> the Lord appeared to <i>Solomon</i>
in a dream by night: and God said, "Ask what I shall give thee."
And Solomon said, "Thou hast shewed unto thy servant <i>David</i>,
my father, great mercy, according as he walked before thee in
truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee,
and thou hast kept from him this great kindness, that thou hast
given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day. And now, O
Lord, my God, thou hast made thy servant King instead of David my
father; and I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or
come in."</p>
<p><b>12.</b> "Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to
judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who
is able to judge this thy so great a people?" And the speech
pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing. And God said
unto him, "Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked
for thyself long life, neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor
hast asked the life of thine enemies, but hast asked for thyself
understanding to discern judgment; behold, I have done according to
thy words, so I have given thee a wise and understanding heart, so
that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall
any arise like unto thee."</p>
<p><b>13.</b> "And I have also given thee that which thou hast not
asked, both riches and honor, so that there shall not be any among
the kings like unto thee all thy days. And if thou wilt walk in my
ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments as thy father
<i>David</i> did walk, then I will lengthen thy days." And Solomon
awoke and behold it was a dream.</p>
<p><b>14.</b> The French poet has shadowed this story in an
allegory, of which he seems to have taken the hint from the fable
of the three goddesses appearing to Paris, or rather from the
vision of <i>Hercules</i>, recorded by <i>Xenophon</i>, where
<i>Pleasure</i> and <i>Virtue</i> are represented as real persons
making their court to the hero with all their several charms and
allurements.</p>
<p><b>15.</b> <i>Health</i>, <i>Wealth</i>, <i>Victory</i> and
<i>Honor</i> are introduced successively in their proper emblems
and characters, each of them spreading her temptations, and
recommending herself to the young monarch's choice. <i>Wisdom</i>
enters last, and so captivates him with her appearance, that he
gives himself up to her. Upon which she informs him, that those who
appeared before her were nothing but her equipage, and that since
he had placed his heart upon <i>Wisdom</i>, <i>Health</i>,
<i>Wealth</i>, <i>Victory</i> and <i>Honor</i> should always wait
an her as her handmaids.</p>

<h2><i>Directions how to spend our Time.</i></h2>
<br>
<p><b>1.</b> We all of us complain of the shortness of time, saith
<i>Seneca</i>, and yet have much more than we know what to do with.
Our lives, says he, are spent either in doing nothing at all, or in
doing nothing to the purpose, or in doing nothing that we ought to
do; we are always complaining our days are few, and acting as
though there would be no end of them. That noble philosopher has
described our inconsistency with ourselves in this particular, by
all those various turns of expression and thought which are
peculiar to his writings.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> I often consider mankind as wholly inconsistent with
itself in a point that bears some affinity to the former. Though we
seem grieved at the shortness of life in general, we are wishing
every period of it at an end. The minor longs to be at age, then to
be a man of business, then to make up an estate, then to arrive at
honors, then to retire. Thus, although the whole of life is allowed
by every one to be short, the several divisions of it appear to be
long and tedious.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> We are for lengthening our span in general, but would
fain contract the parts of which it is composed. The usurer would
be very well satisfied to have all the time annihilated that lies
between the present moment and next quarter day. The politician
would be contented to loose three years of his life, could he place
things in the posture which he fancies they will stand in after
such a revolution of time.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> The lover would be glad to strike out of his existence
all the moments that are to pass away before the happy meeting.
Thus, as far as our time runs, we should be very glad in most parts
of our lives, that it ran much faster than it does. Several hours
of the day hang upon our hands, nay, we wish away whole years; and
travel through time as through a country filled with many wild and
empty wastes which we would fain hurry over, that we may arrive at
those several little settlements or imaginary points of rest, which
are dispersed up and down in it.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> If we may divide the life of most men into twenty
parts, we shall find, that at least nineteen of them are mere gaps
and chasms, which are neither filled with pleasure nor business. I
do not however include in this calculation the life of those men
who are in a perpetual hurry of affairs, but of those only who are
not always engaged in scenes of action: and I hope I shall not do
an unacceptable piece of service to those persons, if I point out
to them certain methods for the filling up their empty spaces of
life. The methods I shall propose to them are as follow:</p>
<p><b>6.</b> The first is the exercise of virtue, in the most
general acceptation of the word. That particular scheme which
comprehends the social virtues, may give employment to the most
industrious temper, and find a man in business more than the most
active station of life. To advise the ignorant, relieve the needy,
comfort the afflicted, are duties that fall in our way almost every
day of our lives.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> A man has frequent opportunities of mitigating the
fierceness of a party; of doing justice to the character of a
deserving man; of softening the envious, quieting the angry, and
rectifying the prejudiced; which, are all of them employments
suited to a reasonable nature, and bring great satisfaction to the
person who can busy himself in them with discretion.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> There is another kind of virtue that may find
employment for those retired hours in which we are altogether left
to ourselves, and destitute of company and conversation: I mean
that intercourse and communication which every reasonable creature
ought to maintain with the great Author of his being.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> The man who lives under an habitual sense of the
divine presence, keeps up a perpetual cheerfulness of temper, and
enjoys every moment the satisfaction of thinking himself in company
with the dearest and best of friends. The time never lies heavy
upon him; it is impossible for him to be alone.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> His thoughts and passions are the most busied at such
hours when those of other men are the most inactive; he no sooner
steps out of the world, but his heart burns with devotion, swells
with hope, and triumphs in the consciousness of that presence which
every where surrounds him; or, on the contrary, pours out its
fears, its sorrows, its apprehensions, to the great supporter of
its existence.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> I have here only considered the necessity of a man's
being virtuous that he may have something to do; but if we consider
further, that the exercise of virtue is not only an amusement for
the time it lasts, but that its influence extends to those parts of
our existence which lie beyond the grave, and that our whole
eternity is to take its colour from those hours which we here
employ in virtue or in vice, the argument redoubles upon us, for
putting in practice this method of passing away our time.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> When a man has but a little stock to improve, and has
opportunities of turning it all to a good account, what shall we
think of him if he suffers nineteen parts of it to lie dead, and
perhaps employs even the twentieth to his ruin or disadvantage? But
because the mind cannot be always in its fervour nor strained up to
a pitch of virtue, it is necessary to find out proper employments
for it in its relaxations.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> The next method therefore that I would propose to
fill up our time, should be useful and innocent diversion. I must
confess I think it is below reasonable creatures to be altogether
conversant in such diversions as are merely innocent, and having
nothing else to recommend them but that there is no hurt in
them.</p>
<p><b>14.</b> Whether any kind of gaming has even thus much to say
for itself, I shall not determine; but I think it is very wonderful
to see persons of the best sense, passing away a dozen hours
together in shuffling and dividing a pack of cards, with no other
conversation but what is made up of a few game phrases, and no
other ideas but those of black or red spots ranged together in
different figures. Would not a man laugh to hear any one of his
species complaining that life is short.</p>
<p><b>15.</b> The stage might be made a perpetual source of the
most noble and useful entertainments, were it under proper
regulations.</p>
<p>But the mind never unbends itself so agreeably as in the
conversation of a well-chosen friend. There is indeed no blessing
of life that is any way comparable to the enjoyment of a discreet
and virtuous friend. It eases and unloads the mind, clears and
improves the understanding, engenders thoughts and knowledge,
animates virtue and good resolution, sooths and allays the
passions, and finds employment for most of the vacant hours of
life.</p>
<p><b>16.</b> Next to such an intimacy with a particular person,
one would endeavour after a more general conversation with such as
are able to entertain and improve those with whom they converse,
which are qualifications that seldom go asunder.</p>
<p>There are many other useful amusements of life, which one would
endeavour to multiply, that one might on all occasions have
recourse to something rather than suffer the mind to lie idle, or
ran adrift with any passion that chances to rise in it.</p>
<p><b>17.</b> A man that has a taste in music, painting, or
architecture, is like one that has another sense when compared with
such as have no relish for those arts. The florist, the planter,
the gardener, the husbandman, when they are only as accomplishments
to the man of fortune; are great reliefs to a country life, and
many ways useful to those who are possessed of them.</p>

<a name='Misspent_time' id="Misspent_time"></a>
<p><b>18.</b> I was yesterday busy in comparing together the
industry of man with that of other creatures; in which I could not
but observe, that notwithstanding we are obliged by duty to keep
ourselves in constant employ, after the same manner as inferior
animals are prompted to it by instinct, we fell very short of them
in this particular.</p>
<p><b>19.</b> We are the more inexcusable, because there is a
greater variety of business to which we may apply ourselves. Reason
opens to us a large field of affairs, which other creatures are not
capable of. Beasts of prey, and I believe all other kinds, in their
natural state of being, divide their time between action and rest.
They are always at work or asleep. In short, their awaking hours
are wholly taken up in seeking after their food, or in consuming
it.</p>
<p><b>20.</b> The human species only, to the great reproach of our
natures, are filled with complaints&mdash;That the day hangs heavy
on them, that they do not know what to do with themselves, that
they are at a loss how to pass away their time, with many of the
like shameful murmurs, which we often find in the mouth of those
who are styled reasonable beings.</p>
<p><b>21.</b> How monstrous are such expressions among creatures
who have the labours of the mind as well as those of the body to
furnish them with proper employments; who, besides the business of
their proper callings and professions, can apply themselves to the
duties of religion, to meditation, to the reading of useful books,
to discourse; in a word, who may exercise themselves in the
unbounded pursuits of knowledge and virtue, and every hour of their
lives make themselves wiser or better than they were before.</p>
<p><b>22.</b> After having been taken up for some time in this
course of thought, I diverted myself with a book, according to my
usual custom, in order to unbend my mind before I went to sleep.
The book I made use of on this occasion was <i>Lucian</i> where I
amused my thoughts for about an hour among the dialogues of the
dead, which in all probability produced the following dream:</p>
<p><b>23.</b> I was conveyed, methought, into the entrance of the
infernal regions, where I saw <i>Rhadamanthus</i>, one of the
judges of the dead, seated in his tribunal. On his left hand stood
the keeper of <i>Erebus</i>, on his right the keeper of
<i>Elysium</i>. I was told he sat upon women that day, there being
several of the sex lately arrived, who had not yet their mansions
assigned them.</p>
<p><b>24.</b> I was surprised to hear him ask every one of them the
same question, namely, What they had been doing? Upon this question
being proposed to the whole assembly they stared upon one another,
as not knowing what to answer. He then interrogated each of them
separately. Madam, says he to the first of them, you have been upon
the earth about fifty years: What have you been doing there all
this while? Doing, says she, really I do not know what I have been
doing: I desire I may have time given me to recollect.</p>
<p><b>25.</b> After about half an hour's pause, she told him that
she had been playing at crimp: upon which <i>Rhadamanthus</i>
beckoned to the keeper on his left hand, to take her into custody.
And you, Madam, says the judge, that look with such a soft and
languishing air; I think you set out for this place in your nine
and twentieth year; what have you been doing all this while? I had
a great deal of business on my hands, says she, being taken up the
first twelve years of my life, in dressing a jointed baby, and all
the remaining part of it in reading plays and romances.</p>
<p><b>26.</b> Very well, says he, you have employed your time to
good purpose. Away with her. The next was a plain country woman:
Well, mistress, says <i>Rhadamanthus</i>, and what have you been
doing? An't please your worship, says she, I did not live quite
forty years; and in that time brought my husband seven daughters,
made him nine thousand cheeses, and left my eldest girl with him to
look after his house in my absence, and who, I may venture to say,
is us pretty a housewife as any in the country.</p>
<p><b>27.</b> <i>Rhadamanthus</i> smiled at the simplicity of the
good woman, and ordered the keeper of <i>Elysium</i>, to take her
into his care. And you, fair lady, says he, what have you been
doing these five and thirty years? I have been doing no hurt, I
assure you sir, said she. That is well, says he, but what good have
you been doing? The lady was in great confusion at this question,
and not knowing what to answer, the two keepers leaped out to seize
her at the same time; the one took her by the hand to convey her to
<i>Elysium</i>; the other caught hold of her to carry her away to
<i>Erebus</i>.</p>
<p><b>28.</b> But <i>Rhadamanthus</i> observing an ingenuous
modesty in her countenance and behaviour, bid them both let her
loose, and set her aside for a re-examination when he was more at
leisure. An old woman, of a proud and sour look, presented herself
next at the bar, and being asked what she had been doing? Truly,
says she, I lived three score and ten years in a very wicked world,
and was so angry at the behaviour of a parcel of young flirts, that
I past most of my last years in condemning the follies of the
times.</p>
<p><b>29.</b> I was every day blaming the silly conduct of people
about me, in order to deter those I conversed with from falling
into the like errors and miscarriages. Very well, says
<i>Rhadamanthus</i>, but did you keep the same watchful eye over
your own actions? Why truly, says she, I was so taken up with
publishing the faults of others, that I had no time to consider my
own.</p>
<p><b>30.</b> Madam, says <i>Rhadamanthus</i>, be pleased to file
off to the left, and make room for the venerable matron that stands
behind you. Old gentlewoman, says he, I think you are fourscore?
You have heard the question, what have you been doing so long in
the world? Ah! sir, says she, I have been doing what I should not
have done, but I had made a firm resolution to have changed my
life, if I had not been snatched off by an untimely end.</p>
<p><b>31.</b> Madam, says he, you will please to follow your
leader, and spying another of the same age, interrogated her in the
same form. To which the matron replied, I have been the wife of a
husband who was as dear to me in his old age as in his youth. I
have been a mother, and very happy in my children, whom I
endeavoured to bring up in every thing that is good.</p>
<p><b>32.</b> My eldest son is blest by the poor, and beloved by
every one that knows him. I lived within my own family, and left it
much more wealthy than I found it. <i>Rhadamanthus</i>, who knew
the value of the old lady smiled upon her in such a manner, that
the keeper of <i>Elysium</i>, who knew his office, reached out his
hand to her. He no sooner touched her but her wrinkles vanished,
her eyes sparkled, her cheeks glowed with blushes, and she appeared
in full bloom and beauty.</p>
<p><b>33.</b> A young woman observing that this officer, who
conducted the happy to <i>Elysium</i>, was so great a
<i>beautifier</i>, longed to be in his hands, so that, pressing
through the croud, she was the next that appeared at the bar, and
being asked what she had been doing the five and twenty years that
she had passed in the world, I have endeavoured, says she, ever
since I came to the years of discretion, to make myself lovely, and
gain admirers.</p>
<p><b>34.</b> In order to do it I past my time in bottling up
Maydew, inventing white-washes, mixing colours, cutting out
patches, consulting my glass, suiting my complexion, tearing off my
tucker, sinking my stays&mdash;<i>Rhadamanthus</i>, without hearing
her out, gave the sign to take her off. Upon the approach of the
keeper of <i>Erebus</i> her colour faded, her face was puckered up
with wrinkles, and her whole person lost in deformity.</p>
<p><b>35.</b> I was then surprised with a distant sound of a whole
troop of females that came forward laughing, singing, and dancing.
I was very desirous to know the reception they would meet with, and
withal was very apprehensive that <i>Rhadamanthus</i> would spoil
their mirth; but at their nearer approach the noise grew so very
great that it awakened me.</p>
<p><b>36.</b> Employment of time is a subject that, from its
importance, deserves your best attention. Most young gentlemen have
a great deal of time before them, and one hour well employed, in
the early part of life, is more valuable and will be of greater use
to you, than perhaps four and twenty, some years to come.</p>
<p><b>37.</b> What ever time you can steal from company and from
the study of the world (I say company, for a knowledge of life is
best learned in various companies) employ it in serious reading.
Take up some valuable book, and continue the reading of that book
till you have got through it; never burden your mind with more than
one thing at a time: and in reading this book do not run it over
superficially, but read every passage twice over, at least do not
pass on to a second till you thoroughly understand the first, nor
quit the book till you are master of the subject; for unless you do
this, you may read it through, and not remember the contents of it
for a week.</p>
<p><b>38.</b> The books I would particularly recommend, are
Cardinal Retz's maxims, Rochefoucault's moral reflections,
Bruyere's characters, Fontenelle's plurality of worlds, Sir Josiah
Child on trade, Bollinbroke's works; for style, his remarks on the
history of England, under the name of Sir John Oldcastle;
Puffendorff's Jus Gentium, and Grotius de Jure Belli et Pacis: the
last two are well translated by <i>Barbeyrac</i>. For occasional
half hours or less, read the best works of invention, wit and
humor; but never waste your minutes on trifling authors, either
ancient or modern.</p>
<p><b>39.</b> Any business you may have to transact, should be done
the first opportunity, and finished, if possible, without
interruption; for by deferring it we may probably finish it too
late, or execute it indifferently. Now, business of any kind should
never be done by halves, but every part of it should be well
attended to: for he that does business ill, had better not do it at
all. And in any point which discretion bids you pursue, and which
has a manifest utility to recommend it, let not difficulties deter
you; rather let them animate your industry. If one method fails,
try a second and a third. Be active, persevere, and you will
certainly conquer.</p>
<p><b>40.</b> Never indulge a lazy disposition, there are few
things but are attended with some difficulties, and if you are
frightened at those difficulties, you will not complete any thing.
Indolent minds prefer ignorance to trouble; they look upon most
things as impossible, because perhaps they are difficult. Even an
hour's attention is too laborious for them, and they would rather
content themselves with the first view of things than take the
trouble to look any farther into them. Thus, when they come to talk
upon subjects to those who have studied them, they betray an
unpardonable ignorance, and lay themselves open to answers that
confuse them. Be careful then, that you do not get the appellation
of indolent, and, if possible, avoid the character of
frivolous.</p>
<p><b>41.</b> For the frivolous mind is busied always upon nothing.
It mistakes trifling objects for important ones, and spends that
time upon little matters, that should only be bestowed upon great
ones. Knick-knacks, butterflies, shells, and such like, engross the
attention of the frivolous man, and fill up all his time. He
studies the dress and not the characters of men, and his subjects
of conversation are no other than the weather, his own domestic
affairs, his servants, his method of managing his family, the
little anecdotes of the neighborhood, and the fiddle-faddle stories
of the day; void of information, void of improvement. These he
relates with emphasis, as interesting matters; in short, he is a
male gossip. I appeal to your own feelings now, whether such things
do not lessen a man in the opinion, of his acquaintance, and
instead of attracting esteem, create disgust.</p>
<br>
<br>
<a name='Modesty' id="Modesty"></a>
<h2><i>Modesty</i>.</h2>
<br>
<p>Modesty is the citidel of beauty and virtue. The first of all
virtues is innocence; the second is modesty.</p>
<p><b>1.</b> Modesty is both in its source, and in its consequence,
a very great happiness to the fair possessor of it; it arises from
a fear of dishonor, and a good conscience, and is followed
immediately, upon its first appearance, with the reward of honor
and esteem, paid by all those who discover it in any body
living.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> It is indeed a virtue in a woman (that might otherwise
be very disagreeable to one) so exquisitely delicate, that it
excites in any beholder, of a generous and manly disposition,
almost all the passions that he would be apt to conceive for the
mistress of his heart, in variety of circumstances.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> A woman that is modest creates in us an awe in her
company, a wish for her welfare, a joy in her being actually happy,
a sore and painful sorrow if distress should come upon her, a ready
and willing heart to give her consolation, and a compassionate
temper towards her, in every little accident of life she undergoes;
and to sum up all in one word, it causes such a kind of angelical
love, even to a stranger, as good natured brothers and sisters
usually bear towards one another.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> It adds wonderfully to the make of a face, and I have
seen a pretty well turned forehead, fine set eyes, and what your
poets call, a row of pearl set in coral, shewn by a pretty
expansion of two velvet lips that covered them (that would have
tempted any sober man living of my own age, to have been a little
loose in his thoughts, and to have enjoyed a painful pleasure
amidst his impotency) lose all their virtue, all their force and
efficacy, by having an ugly cast of boldness very discernibly
spread out at large over all those alluring features.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> At the same time modesty will fill up the wrinkles of
old age with glory; make sixty blush itself into sixteen; and help
a green sick girl to defeat the satyr of a false waggish lover, who
might compare her colour, when she looked like a ghost, to the
blowing of the rose-bud, by blushing herself into a bloom of
beauty; and might make what he meant a reflection, a real
compliment, at any hour of the day, in spite of his teeth. It has a
prevailing power with me, whenever I find it in the sex.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> I who have the common fault of old men, to be very
sour and humoursome, when I drink my water-gruel in a morning, fell
into a more than ordinary pet with a maid whom I call my nurse,
from a constant tenderness, that I have observed her to exercise
towards me beyond all my other servants; I perceived her flush and
glow in the face, in a manner which I could plainly discern
proceeded not from anger or resentment of my correction, but from a
good natured regret, upon a fear that she had offended her grave
old master.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> I was so heartily pleased, that I eased her of the
honest trouble she underwent inwardly far my sake; and giving her
half a crown, I told her it was a forfeit due to her because I was
out of humour with her without any reason at all. And as she is so
gentle-hearted, I have diligently avoided giving her one harsh word
ever since: and I find my own reward in it: for not being so testy
as I used, has made me much haler and stronger than I was
before.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> The pretty, and witty, and virtuous <i>Simplicia</i>,
was, the other day, visiting with an old aunt of her's, that I
verily believe has read the <i>Atalantis</i>; she took a story out
there, and dressed up an old honest neighbour in the second hand
clothes of scandal. The young creature hid her face with her fan at
every burst and peal of laughter, and blushed for her guilty
parent; by which she atoned, methought, for every scandal that ran
round the beautiful circle.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> As I was going home to bed that evening, I could not
help thinking of her all the way I went. I represented her to
myself as shedding holy blood every time she blushed, and as being
a martyr in the cause of virtue. And afterwards, when I was putting
on my night-cap, I could not drive the thought out of my head, but
that I was young enough to be married to her; and that it would be
an addition to the reputation I have in the study of wisdom, to
marry to so much youth and modesty, even in my old age.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> I know there have not been wanting many wicked
objections against this virtue; one is grown insufferably common.
The fellow blushes, he is guilty. I should say rather, He blushes,
therefore he is innocent. I believe the same man, that first had
that wicked imagination of a blush being the sign of guilt,
represented good nature to be folly; and that he himself, was the
most inhuman and impudent wretch alive.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> The author of <i>Cato</i>, who is known to be one of
the most modest, and most ingenious persons of the age we now live
in, has given this virtue a delicate name in the tragedy of
<i>Cato</i>, where the character of <i>Marcia</i> is first opened
to us. I would have all ladies who have a mind to be thought
well-bred, to think seriously on this virtue, which he so
beautifully calls the sanctity of manners.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> Modesty is a polite accomplishment, and generally an
attendant upon merit. It is engaging to the highest degree, and
wins the hearts of all our acquaintance. On the contrary, none are
more disgustful in company than the impudent and presuming.</p>
<p>The man who is, on all occasions, commending and speaking well
of himself, we naturally dislike. On the other hand, he who studies
to conceal his own deserts, who does justice to the merit of
others, who talks but little of himself, and that with modesty,
makes a favourable impression on the persons he is conversing with,
captivates their minds, and gains their esteem.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> Modesty, however, widely differs from an aukward
bashfulness; which is as much to be condemned as the other is to be
applauded. To appear simple is as ill-bred as to be impudent. A
young man ought to be able to come into a room and address the
company without the least embarrassment. To be out of countenance
when spoken to, and not to have an answer ready, is ridiculous to
the last degree.</p>
<p><b>14.</b> An aukward country fellow, when he comes into company
better than himself, is exceedingly disconcerted. He knows not what
to do with his hands or his hat, but either puts one of them in his
pocket, and dangles the other by his side: or perhaps twirls his
hat on his fingers, or perhaps fumbles with the button. If spoken
to he is in a much worse situation; he answers with the utmost
difficulty, and nearly stammers; whereas a gentleman who is
acquainted with life, enters a room with gracefulness and a modest
assurance; addresses even persons he does not know, in an easy and
natural manner, and without the least embarrassment.</p>
<p><b>15.</b> This is the characteristic of good-breeding, a very
necessary knowledge in our intercourse with men; for one of
inferior parts, with the behaviour of a gentleman, is frequently
better received than a man of sense, with the address and manners
of a clown. Ignorance and vice are the only things we need be
ashamed of; steer clear of these, and you may go into any company
you will; not that I would have a young man throw off all dread of
appearing abroad; as a fear of offending, or being disesteemed,
will make him preserve a proper decorum.</p>
<p><b>16.</b> Some persons, from experiencing the bad effects of
false modesty, have run into the other extreme, and acquired the
character of impudent. This is as great a fault as the other. A
well-bred man keeps himself within the two, and steers the middle
way. He is easy and firm in every company; is modest, but not
bashful; steady, but not impudent. He copies the manners of the
better people, and conforms to their customs with ease and
attention.</p>
<p><b>17.</b> Till we can present ourselves in all companies with
coolness and unconcern, we can never present ourselves well; nor
will man ever be supposed to have kept good company, or ever be
acceptable in such company, if he cannot appear there easy and
unembarrassed. A modest assurance in every part of life, is the
most advantageous qualification we can possibly acquire.</p>
<p><b>18.</b> Instead of becoming insolent, a man of sense, under a
consciousness of merit, is more modest. He behaves himself indeed
with firmness, but without the least presumption. The man who is
ignorant of his own merit is no less a fool than he who is
constantly displaying it. A man of understanding avails himself of
his abilities but never boasts of them; whereas the timid and
bashful can never push himself in life, be his merit as great as it
will; he will be always kept behind by the forward and the
bustling.</p>
<p><b>19.</b> A man of abilities, and acquainted with life, will
stand as firm in defence of his own rights, and pursue his plans as
steadily and unmoved as the most impudent man alive; but then he
does it with a seeming modesty. Thus, manner is every thing; what
is impudence in one is proper assurance only in another: for
firmness is commendable, but an overbearing conduct is
disgustful.</p>
<p><b>20.</b> Forwardness being the very reverse of modesty, follow
rather than lead the company; that is, join in discourse upon their
subjects rather than start one of your own; if you have parts, you
will have opportunities enough of shewing them on every topic of
conversation; and if you have none, it is better to expose yourself
upon a subject of other people's, than on one of your own.</p>
<p><b>21.</b> But be particularly careful not to speak of yourself
if you can help it. An impudent fellow lugs in himself abruptly
upon all occasions, and is ever the here of his own story. Others
will colour their arrogance with, "It may seem strange indeed, that
I should talk in this manner of myself; it is what I by no means
like, and should never do, if I had not been cruelly and unjustly
accused; but when my character is attacked, it is a justice I owe
to myself to defend it." This veil is too thin not to be seen
through on the first inspection.</p>
<p><b>22.</b> Others again, with more art, will <i>modestly</i>
boast of all the principal virtues, by calling these virtues
weaknesses, and saying, they are so unfortunate as to fall into
those weaknesses. "I cannot see persons suffer," says one of his
cast, "without relieving them; though my circumstances are very
unable to afford it&mdash;I cannot avoid speaking truth; though it
is often very imprudent;" and so on.</p>
<p><b>23.</b> This angling for praise is so prevailing a principle,
that it frequently stoops to the lowest object. Men will often
boast of doing that, which, if true, would be rather a disgrace to
them than otherwise. One man affirms that he rode twenty miles
within the hour: 'tis probably a lie; but suppose he did, what
then? He had a good horse under him, and is a good jockey. Another
swears he has often at a sitting, drank five or six bottles to his
own share. Out of respect to him, I will believe <i>him</i> a liar;
for I would not wish to think him a beast.</p>
<p><b>24.</b> These and many more are the follies of idle people,
which, while they think they procure them esteem, in reality make
them despised.</p>
<p>To avoid this contempt, therefore, never speak of yourself at
all, unless necessity obliges you; and even then, take care to do
it in such a manner, that it may not be construed into fishing for
applause. Whatever perfections you may have, be assured, people
will find them out; but whether they do or not, nobody will take
them upon your own word. The less you say of yourself, the more the
world will give you credit for; and the more you say, the less they
will believe you.</p>

<a name='Affectation' id="Affectation"></a>
<h2><i>Affectation</i>.</h2>
<br>
<p><b>1.</b> A late conversation which I fell into, gave me an
opportunity of observing a great deal of beauty in a very handsome
woman, and as much wit in an ingenious man, turned into deformity
in the one, and absurdity in the other, by the mere force of
affectation. The fair one had something in her person upon which
her thoughts were fixed, that she attempted to shew to advantage in
every look, word and gesture.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> The gentleman was as diligent to do justice to his
fine parts, as the lady to her beauteous form: you might see his
imagination on the stretch to find out something uncommon, and what
they call bright, to entertain her: while she writhed herself into
as many different postures to engage him. When she laughed, her
lips were to sever at a greater distance than ordinary to shew her
teeth.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> Her fan was to point to somewhat at a distance, that
in the reach she may discover the roundness of her arm; then she is
utterly mistaken in what she saw, falls back, smiles at her own
folly, and is so wholly discomposed, that her tucker is to be
adjusted, her bosom exposed, and the whole woman put into new airs
and graces.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> While she was doing all this, the gallant had time to
think of something very pleasant to say next to her, or make some
unkind observation on some other lady to feed her vanity. These
unhappy effects of affectation naturally led me to look into that
strange state of mind, which so generally discolours the behaviour
of most people we meet with.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> The learned Dr. <i>Burnet</i>, in his Theory of the
Earth, takes occasion to observe, that every thought is attended
with consciousness and representativeness; the mind has nothing
presented to it, but what is immediately followed by a reflection
of conscience, which tells you whether that which was so presented
is graceful or unbecoming.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> This act of the mind discovers itself in the gesture,
by a proper behaviour in those whose consciousness goes no farther
than to direct them in the just progress of their present thought
or action; but betrays an interruption in every second thought,
when the consciousness is employed in too fondly approving a man's
own conceptions; which sort of consciousness is what we call
affectation.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> As the love of praise is implanted in our bosoms as a
strong incentive to worthy actions; it is a very difficult task to
get above a desire of it for things that should be wholly
indifferent. Women, whose hearts are fixed upon the pleasure they
have in the consciousness that they are the objects of love and
admiration, are ever changing the air of their countenances, and
altering the attitude of their bodies, to strike the hearts of
their beholders with a new sense of their beauty.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> The dressing part of our sex, whose minds are the same
with the sillier part of the other, are exactly in the like uneasy
condition to be regarded for a well tied cravat, an hat cocked with
an unusual briskness, a very well chosen coat, or other instances
of merit, which they are impatient to see unobserved.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> But this apparent affectation, arising from an ill
governed consciousness, is not so much to be wondered at in such
loose and trivial minds as these. But when you see it reign in
characters of worth and distinction, it is what you cannot but
lament, nor without some indignation. It creeps into the heart of
the wise man, as well as that of the coxcomb.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> When you see a man of sense look about for applause,
and discover an itching inclination to be commended; lay traps for
a little incense, even from those whose opinion he values in
nothing but his own favour; who is safe against this weakness? or
who knows whether he is guilty of it or not? The best way to get
clear of such a light fondness for applause is, to take all
possible care to throw off the love of it upon occasions that are
not in themselves laudable; but, as it appears, we hope for no
praise from them.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> Of this nature are all graces in men's persons,
dress, and bodily deportment; which will naturally be winning and
attractive if we think not of them, but lose their force in
proportion to our endeavour to make them such.</p>
<p>When our consciousness turns upon the main design of life, and
our thoughts are employed upon the chief purpose either in business
or pleasure, we should never betray an affectation, for we cannot
be guilty of it, but when we give the passion for praise an
unbridled liberty, our pleasure in little perfections robs us of
what is due to us for great virtues and worthy qualities.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> How many excellent speeches and honest actions are
lost, for want of being indifferent where we ought! Men are
oppressed with regard to their way of speaking and acting, instead
of having their thoughts bent upon what they should do or say; and
by that means bury a capacity for great things, by their fear of
failing in indifferent things. This, perhaps, cannot be called
affectation; but it has some tincture of it, at least so far, as
that their fear of erring in a thing of no consequence argues they
would be too much pleased in performing it.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> It is only from a thorough disregard to himself in
such particulars, that a man can act with a laudable sufficiency;
his heart is fixed upon one point in view; and he commits no
errors, because he thinks nothing an error but what deviates from
that intention.</p>
<p>The wild havock affectation makes in that part of the world
which should be most polite, is visible wherever we turn our eyes;
it pushes men not only into impertinences in conversation, but also
in their premeditated speeches.</p>
<p><b>14.</b> At the bar it torments the bench, whose business it
is to cut off all superfluities in what is spoken before it by the
practitioner; as well as several little pieces of injustice which
arise from the law itself. I have seen it make a man run from the
purpose before a judge, who at the bar himself, so close and
logical a pleader, that with all the pomp of eloquence in his
power, he never spoke a word too much.</p>
<p><b>15.</b> It might be borne even here, but it often ascends the
pulpit itself; and the declaimer, in that sacred place, is
frequently so impertinently witty, speaks of the last day itself
with so many quaint phrases, that there is no man who understands
raillery, but must resolve to sin no more; nay, you may behold him
sometimes in prayer, for a proper delivery of the great truths he
is to utter, humble himself with a very well turned phrase, and
mention his unworthiness in a way so very becoming, that the air of
the pretty gentleman is preserved, under the lowliness of the
preacher.</p>
<p><b>16.</b> I shall end this with a short letter I wrote the
other day to a very witty man, over-run with the fault I am now
speaking of.</p>
<p>'DEAR SIR,</p>
<p>I spent some time with you the other day, and must take the
liberty of a friend to tell you of the insufferable affectation you
are guilty of in all you say and do.</p>
<p><b>17.</b> When I gave you a hint of it, you asked me whether a
man is to be cold to what his friends think of him? No, but praise
is not to be the entertainment of every moment: he that hopes for
it must be able to suspend the possession of it till proper periods
of life, or death itself. If you would not rather be commended than
be praiseworthy, contemn little merits; and allow no man to be so
free with you, as to praise you to your face.</p>
<p><b>18.</b> Your vanity by this means will want its food. At the
same time your passion for esteem will be more fully gratified; men
will praise you in their actions: where you now receive one
compliment you will then receive twenty civilities. Till then you
will never have of either, further than,</p>
<div style='text-align: right; margin-right: 10%;'>SIR,<br>

<br>
SPECTATOR, Vol. 1. No. 38.</div>
<a name='Affection_Continued' id="Affection_Continued"></a>
<p><b>19.</b> Nature does nothing in vain; the Creator of the
Universe has appointed every thing to a certain use and purpose,
and determined it to a settled course and sphere of action, from
which, if it in the least deviates, it becomes unfit to answer
those ends for which it was designed.</p>
<p><b>20.</b> In like manner it is in the disposition of society:
the civil &oelig;conomy is formed in a chain as well as the
natural; and in either case the breach but of one link puts the
whole in some disorder. It is, I think, pretty plain, that most of
the absurdity and ridicule we meet with in the world, is generally
owing to the impertinent affectation of excelling in characters men
are not fit for, and for which nature never designed them.</p>
<p><b>21.</b> Every man has one or more qualities which may make
him useful both to himself and others: Nature never fails of
pointing them out, and while the infant continues under her
guardianship, she brings him on in his way, and then offers herself
for a guide in what remains of the journey; if he proceeds in that
course, he can hardly miscarry: Nature makes good her engagements;
for as she never promises what she is not able to perform, so she
never fails of performing what she promises.</p>
<p><b>22.</b> But the misfortune is, men despise what they may be
masters of, and affect what they are not fit for; they reckon
themselves already possessed of what their genius inclines them to,
and so bend all their ambition to excel in what is out of their
reach; thus they destroy the use of their natural talents, in the
same manner as covetous men do their quiet and repose; they can
enjoy no satisfaction in what they have, because of the absurd
inclination they are possessed with for what they have not.</p>
<p><b>23.</b> <i>Cleanthes</i> had good sense, a great memory, and
a constitution capable of the closest application: in a word, there
was no profession in which <i>Cleanthes</i> might not have made a
very good figure; but this won't satisfy him; he takes up an
unaccountable fondness for the character of a line gentleman; all
his thoughts are bent upon this, instead of attending a dissection,
frequenting the courts of justice, or studying the Fathers.</p>
<p><b>24.</b> <i>Cleanthes</i> reads plays, dances, dresses, and
spends his time in drawing rooms, instead of being a good lawyer,
divine, or physician; <i>Cleanthes</i> is a down-right coxcomb, and
will remain to all that knew him a contemptible example of talents
misapplied. It is to this affectation the world owes its whole race
of coxcombs; Nature in her whole drama never drew such a part; she
has sometimes made a fool, but a coxcomb is always of a man's own
making, by applying his talents otherwise than nature designed, who
ever bears an high resentment for being put out of her course, and
never fails of taking revenge on those that do so.</p>
<p><b>25.</b> Opposing her tendency in the application of a man's
parts, has the same success as declining from her course in the
production of vegetables; by the assistance of art and an hot bed,
we may possibly extort an unwilling plant, or an untimely sallad;
but how weak, how tasteless, and insipid! Just as insipid as the
poetry of <i>Valerio</i>.</p>
<p><b>26.</b> <i>Valerio</i> had an universal character, was
genteel, had learning, thought justly, spoke correctly; 'twas
believed there was nothing in which <i>Valerio</i> did not excel;
and 'twas so far true, that there was but one: <i>Valerio</i> had
no genius for poetry, yet was resolved to be a poet; he writes
verses, and takes great pains to convince the town, that
<i>Valerio</i> is not that extraordinary person he was taken
for.</p>
<p><b>27.</b> If men would be content to graft upon nature, and
assist her operations, what mighty effects might we expect?
<i>Tully</i> would not stand so much alone in oratory,
<i>Virgil</i> in poetry, or <i>C&aelig;sar</i> in war. To build
upon nature, is laying the foundation upon a rock; every thing
disposes itself into order as it were of course, and the whole work
is half done as soon as undertaken. <i>Cicero's</i> genius inclined
him to oratory, <i>Virgil</i>'s to follow the train of the muses;
they piously obeyed the admonition, and were rewarded.</p>
<p><b>28.</b> Had <i>Virgil</i> attended the bar, his modest and
ingenuous virtue would surely have made but a very indifferent
figure: and <i>Tully</i>'s declamatory inclination would have been
as useless in poetry. Nature, if left to herself, leads us on in
the best course, but will do nothing by compulsion and constraint;
and if we are not satisfied to go her way, we are always the
greatest sufferers by it.</p>
<p><b>29.</b> Wherever nature designs a production, she always
disposes seeds proper for it, which are as absolutely necessary to
the formation of any moral or intellectual existence, as they are
to the being and growth of plants; and I know not by what fate and
folly it is, that men are taught not to reckon him equally absurd
that will write verses in spite of nature, with that gardener that
should undertake to raise a jonquil or tulip, without the help of
their respective seeds.</p>
<p><b>30.</b> As there is no good or bad quality that does not
affect both sexes, so it is not to be imagined but the fair sex
must have suffered by an affectation of this nature, at least as
much as the other: the ill effect of it is in none so conspicuous
as in the two opposite characters of <i>C&aelig;lia</i> and
<i>Iras</i>. <i>C&aelig;lia</i> has all the charms of person,
together with an abundant sweetness of nature, but wants wit, and
has a very ill voice: <i>Iras</i> is ugly and ungenteel, but has
wit and good sense.</p>
<p><b>31.</b> If <i>C&aelig;lia</i> would be silent, her beholders
would adore her; if <i>Iras</i> would talk, her hearers would
admire her; but <i>C&aelig;lia</i>'s tongue runs incessantly, while
<i>Iras</i> gives herself silent airs and soft languors; so that
'tis difficult to persuade one's self that <i>C&aelig;lia</i> has
beauty, and <i>Iras</i> wit: each neglects her own excellence, and
is ambitious of the other's character: <i>Iras</i> would be thought
to have as much beauty as <i>C&aelig;lia</i>, and
<i>C&aelig;lia</i> as much wit as <i>Iras</i>.</p>
<p><b>32.</b> The great misfortune of this affectation is, that men
not only lose a good quality, but also contract a bad one: they not
only are unfit for what they were designed, but they assign
themselves to what they are not fit for; and instead of making a
very good, figure one way, make a very ridiculous one in
another.</p>
<p><b>33.</b> If <i>Semanthe</i> would have been satisfied with her
natural complexion, she might still have been celebrated by the
name of the olive beauty; but <i>Semanthe</i> has taken up an
affectation to white and red, and is now distinguished by the
character of the lady that paints so well.</p>
<p><b>34.</b> In a word, could the world be reformed to the
obedience of that famed dictate, <i>follow nature</i>, which the
oracle of <i>Delphos</i> pronounced to <i>Cicero</i> when he
consulted what course of studies he should pursue, we should see
almost every man as eminent in his proper sphere as <i>Tully</i>
was in his, and should in a very short time find impertinence and
affectation banished from among the women, and coxcombs and false
characters from among the men.</p>
<p><b>35.</b> For my part I could never consider this preposterous
repugnancy to nature any otherwise, than not only as the greatest
folly, but also one of the most heinous crimes, since it is a
direct opposition to the disposition of providence, and (as
<i>Tully</i> expresses it) like the sin of the giants, an actual
rebellion against heaven.</p>

<h2><i>Good Humour and Nature</i>.</h2>
<br>
<p><b>1.</b> A man advanced in years that thinks fit to look back
upon his former life, and calls that only life which was passed
with satisfaction and enjoyment, excluding all parts which were not
pleasant to him, will find himself very young, if not in his
infancy. Sickness, ill-humour, and idleness, will have robbed him
of a great share of that space we ordinarily call our life.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> It is therefore the duty of every man that would be
true to himself, to obtain, if possible, a disposition to be
pleased, and place himself in a constant aptitude for the
satisfaction of his being. Instead of this, you hardly see a man
who is not uneasy in proportion to his advancement in the arts of
life.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> An affected delicacy is the common improvement we meet
with in these who pretend to be refined above others: they do not
aim at true pleasure themselves, but turn their thoughts upon
observing the false pleasures of other men. Such people are
valetudinarians in society, and they should no more come into
company than a sick man should come into the air.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> If a man is too weak to bear what is a refreshment to
men in health, he must still keep his chamber. When any one in Sir
<i>Roger</i>'s company complains he is out of order, he immediately
calls for some posset drink for him; for which reason that sort of
people, who are ever bewailing their constitutions in other places,
are the cheerfulest imaginable when he is present.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> It is a wonderful thing that so many, and they not
reckoned absurd, shall entertain those with whom they converse, by
giving them the history of their pains and aches; and imagine such
narrations their quota of the conversation. This is, of all others,
the-meanest help to discourse, and a man must not think at all, or
think himself very insignificant, when he finds an account of his
head ache answered by another asking, what news in the last
mail?</p>
<p><b>6.</b> Mutual good humour is a dress we ought to appear in
wherever we meet, and we should make no mention of what concerns
ourselves, without it be of matters wherein our friends ought to
rejoice: but indeed there are crowds of people who put themselves
in no method of pleasing themselves or others; such are those whom
we usually call indolent persons.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> Indolence is, methinks, an intermediate state between
pleasure and pain, and very much unbecoming any part of our life
after we are out of the nurse's arms. Such an aversion to labour
creates a constant weariness, and one would think should make
existence itself a burden.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> The indolent man descends from the dignity of his
nature, and makes that being which was rational, merely vegetative;
his life consists only in the mere increase and decay of a body,
which, with relation to the rest of the world, might as well have
been uninformed, as the habitation of a reasonable mind.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> Of this kind is the life of that extraordinary couple,
<i>Harry Tersett</i> and his lady. <i>Harry</i> was, in the days of
his celibacy, one of those pert creatures who have much vivacity
and little understanding; Mrs. <i>Rebecca Quickly</i>, whom he
married, had all that the fire of youth and a lively manner could
do towards making an agreeable woman.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> These two people of seeming merit fell into each
other's arms; and passion being sated, and no reason or good sense
in either to succeed it, their life is now at a stand; their meals
are insipid, and time tedious; their fortune has placed them above
care, and their loss of taste reduced them below diversion.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> When we talk of these as instances of inexistence, we
do not mean, that in order to live it is necessary we should always
be in jovial crews, or crowned with chaplets of roses, as the merry
fellows among the ancients are described; but it is intended by
considering these contraries to pleasure, indolence and too much
delicacy, to shew that it is prudent to preserve a disposition in
ourselves, to receive a certain delight in all we hear and see.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> This portable quality of good-humour seasons all the
parts and occurrences we meet with; in such a manner, that there
are no moments lost; but they all pass with so much satisfaction,
that the heaviest of loads (when it is a load) that of time, is
never felt by us.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> <i>Varilas</i> has this quality to the highest
perfection, and communicates it wherever he appears: the sad, the
merry, the severe, the melancholy, shew a new cheerfulness when he
comes amongst them. At the same time no one can repeat any thing
that <i>Varilas</i> has ever said that deserves repetition; but the
man has that innate goodness of temper, that he is welcome to every
body, because every man thinks he is so to him.</p>
<p><b>14.</b> He does not seem to contribute any thing to the mirth
of the company; and yet upon reflection you find it all happened by
his being there. I thought it was whimsically said of a gentleman,
That if <i>Varilas</i> had wit, it would be the best wit in the
world. It is certain when a well corrected lively imagination and
good-breeding are added to a sweet disposition, they qualify it to
be one of the greatest blessings, as well as pleasures of life.</p>
<p><b>15.</b> Men would come into company with ten times the
pleasure they do, if they were sure of bearing nothing which should
shock them, as well as expected what would please them. When we
know every person that is spoken of is represented by one who has
no ill-will, and every thing that is mentioned described by one
that is apt to set it in the best light, the entertainment must be
delicate, because the cook has nothing bought to his hand, but what
is the most excellent in its kind.</p>
<p><b>16.</b> Beautiful pictures are the entertainments of pure
minds, and deformities of the corrupted. It is a degree towards the
life of angels, when we enjoy conversation wherein there is nothing
present but in its excellence; and a degree towards that of demons,
wherein nothing is shewn but in its degeneracy.</p>

<a name='Friendship' id="Friendship"></a>
<h2><i>Friendship</i>.</h2>
<br>
<p><b>1.</b> One would think that the larger the company is in
which we are engaged, the greater variety of thoughts and subjects
would be started in discourse; but instead of this, we find that
conversation is never so much straitened and confined as in
numerous assemblies.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> When a multitude meet together upon any subject of
discourse, their debates are taken up chiefly with forms; and
general positions; nay, if we come into a more contracted assembly
of men and women, the talk generally runs upon the weather,
fashions, news, and the like public topics.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> In proportion as conversation gets into clubs and
knots of friends, it descends into particulars, and grows more free
and communicative; but the most open, instructive, and unreserved
discourse, is that which passes between two persons who are
familiar and intimate friends.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> On these occasions, a man gives a loose to every
passion, and every thought that is uppermost discovers his most
retired opinions of persons and things, tries the beauty and
strength of his sentiments, and exposes his whole soul to the
examination of his friend.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> <i>Tully</i> was the first who observed, that
friendship improves happiness and abates misery, by the doubling of
our joy and dividing of our grief; a thought in which he hath been
followed by all the essayers upon friendship, that have written
since his time. Sir <i>Francis Bacon</i> has finally described
other advantages, or, as he calls them, fruits of friendship; and
indeed there is no subject of morality which has been better
handled and more exhausted than this.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> Among the several fine things which have been spoken
of, I shall beg leave to quote some out of a very ancient author,
whose book would be regarded by our modern wits as one of the most
shining tracts of morality that is extant, if it appeared under the
name of a <i>Confucius</i> or of any celebrated Grecian
philosopher; I mean the little Apocryphal Treatise, entitled the
Wisdom of the Son of <i>Sirach</i>.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> How finely has he described the art of making friends,
by an obliging and affable behaviour! And laid down that precept
which a late excellent author has delivered as his own, "That we
should have many well-wishers, but few friends." Sweet language
will multiply friends; and a fair-speaking tongue will increase
kind greetings. Be in peace with many, nevertheless have but one
counsellor of a thousand.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> With what prudence does he caution us in the choice of
our friends! And with what strokes of nature (I could almost say of
humour) has he described the behaviour of a treacherous and
self-interested friend&mdash;"If thou wouldest get a friend, prove
him first, and be not hasty to credit him: for some man is a friend
for his own occasion, and will not abide in the day of thy
trouble."</p>
<p><b>9.</b> "And there is a friend, who being turned to enmity and
strife, will discover thy reproach." Again, "Some friend is a
companion at the table, and will not continue in the day of thy
affliction: but in thy prosperity he will be as thyself, and will
be bold over thy servants. If thou be brought low, he will be
against thee, and hide himself from thy face."</p>
<p><b>10.</b> What can be more strong and pointed than the
following verse? "Separate thyself from thine enemies, and take
heed of thy friends." In the next words he particularizes one of
those fruits of friendship which is described at length by the two
famous authors above mentioned, and falls into a general eulogium
of friendship, which is very just as well as very sublime.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> "A faithful friend is a strong defence; and he that
hath found such a one, hath found a treasure. Nothing doth
countervail a faithful friend, and his excellence is invaluable. A
faithful friend is the medicine of life; and they that fear the
Lord, shall find him. Whoso feareth the Lord, shall direct his
friendship aright; for as he is, so shall his neighbour (that is,
his friend) be also."</p>
<p><b>12.</b> I do not remember to have met with any saying that
has pleased me more than that of a friend's being the medicine of
life, to express the efficacy of friendship in healing the pains
and anguish which naturally cleave to our existence in this world;
and am wonderfully pleased with the turn in the last sentence, That
a virtuous man shall, as a blessing, meet with a friend who is as
virtuous as himself.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> There is another saying in the same author, which
would have been very much admired in an heathen writer: "Forsake
not an old friend, for the new is not comparable to him: a new
friend is as new wine; when it is old thou shalt drink it with
pleasure."</p>
<p><b>14.</b> With what strength of allusion, and force of thought,
has he described the breaches and violations of friendship! "Whoso
casteth a stone at the birds, frayeth them away; and he that
upbraideth his friend, breaketh friendship. Though thou drawest a
sword at a friend, yet despair not, for there may be a returning to
favor; if thou hast opened thy mouth against thy friend, fear not,
for there may be a reconciliation; except for upbraiding, or pride,
or disclosing of secrets, or a treacherous wound; for, for these
things, every friend will depart."</p>
<p><b>15.</b> We may observe in this and several other precepts in
this author, those little familiar instances and illustrations
which are so much admired in the moral writings of <i>Horace</i>
and <i>Epictetus</i>. There are very beautiful instances of this
nature in the following pages, which are likewise written upon the
same subject:</p>
<p><b>16.</b> "Whoso discovereth secrets, loseth his credit, and
shall never find a friend to his mind. Love thy friend, and be
faithful unto him; but if thou betrayest his secret, follow no more
after him; for as a man hath destroyed his enemy, so hast thou lost
the love of thy friend; as one that letteth a bird go out of his
hand, so hast thou let thy friend go, and shall not get him again:
follow after him no more, for he is too far off; he is as a roe
escaped out of the snare. As for a wound, it may be bound up, and
after reviling, there may be reconciliation; but he that betrayeth
secrets, is without hope."</p>
<p><b>17.</b> Among the several qualifications of a good friend,
this wise man has very justly singled out constancy and
faithfulness as the principal; to these, others have added virtue,
knowledge, discretion, equality in age and fortune, and, as
<i>Cicero</i> calls it, <i>morum comitas</i>, a pleasantness of
temper.</p>
<p><b>18.</b> If I were to give my opinion upon such an exhausted
subject, I should join to these other qualifications a certain
&aelig;quibility or evenness of behaviour. A man often contracts a
friendship with one whom perhaps he does not find out till after a
year's conversation: when, on a sudden, some latent ill-humour
breaks out upon him, which he never discovered or suspected at his
first entering into an intimacy with him.</p>
<p><b>19.</b> There are several persons who, in some certain
periods of their lives, are inexpressibly agreeable, and in others
as odious and detestable. <i>Martial</i> has given us a very pretty
picture of one of these species in the following epigram:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'><span><i>Difficilis facilas, jocundus, acerbus,
es idem</i>,<br></span> <span><i>Nec tecum possum vivere; nec sine
te</i>.<br></span></div>
<div style='text-align: right; margin-right: 45%;'>Epig. 47. 1.
12.</div>
<div class='stanza'><span>In all thy humours, whether grave or
mellow,<br></span> <span>Thou'rt such a touchy, testy, pleasant
fellow;<br></span> <span>Hast so much wit and mirth, and spleen
about thee,<br></span> <span>There is no living with thee nor
without thee.<br></span></div>
</div>
<p><b>20.</b> It is very unlucky for a man to be entangled in a
friendship with one, who by these changes and vicissitudes of
humour is sometimes amiable, and sometimes odious: and as most men
are at some times in an admirable frame and disposition of mind, it
should be one of the greatest tasks of wisdom to keep ourselves
well when we are so, and never to go out of that which is the
agreeable part of our character.</p>
<div style='text-align: right; margin-right: 10%;'>SPECTATOR, Vol.
1. No. 68.</div>
<p><b>21.</b> "Friendship is a strong and habitual inclination in
two persons to promote the good and happiness of one another."
Though the pleasures and advantages of friendship have been largely
celebrated by the best moral writers, and are considered by all as
great ingredients of human happiness, we very rarely meet with the
practice of this virtue an the world.</p>
<p><b>22.</b> Every man is ready to give a long catalogue of those
virtues and good qualities he expects to find in the person of a
friend, but very few of us are careful to cultivate them in
ourselves.</p>
<p>Love and esteem are the first principles of friendship, which
always is imperfect where either of these two is wanting.</p>
<p><b>23.</b> As on the one hand, we are soon ashamed of loving a
man whom we cannot esteem; so on the other, though we are truly
sensible of a man's abilities, we can never raise ourselves to the
warmths of friendship, without an affectionate good will towards
his person.</p>
<p><b>24.</b> Friendship immediately banishes envy under all its
disguises. A man who can once doubt whether he should rejoice in
his friend's being happier than himself, may depend upon it, that
he is an utter stranger to this virtue.</p>
<p><b>25.</b> There is something in friendship so very great and
noble, that in those fictitious stories which are invented to the
honor of any particular person, the authors have thought it as
necessary to make their hero a friend as a lover. <i>Achilles</i>
has his <i>Patroclus</i>, and <i>&AElig;neas</i> his
<i>Achates</i>.</p>
<p><b>26.</b> In the first of these instances we may observe, for
the reputation of the subject I am treating of, that <i>Greece</i>
was almost ruined by the hero's love, but was preserved by his
friendship.</p>
<p><b>27.</b> The character of <i>Achates</i> suggests to us an
observation we may often make on the intimacies of great men, who
frequently choose their companions rather for the qualities of the
heart, than those of the head: and prefer fidelity, in an easy,
inoffensive, complying temper, to those endowments which make a
much greater figure among mankind.</p>
<p><b>28.</b> I do not remember that <i>Achates</i>, who is
represented as the first favourite, either gives his advice, or
strikes a blow through the whole <i>&AElig;neid</i>.</p>
<p>A friendship, which makes the least noise, is very often most
useful; for which reason I should prefer a prudent friend to a
zealous one.</p>
<p><b>29.</b> <i>Atticus</i>, one of the best men of ancient
<i>Rome</i>, was a very remarkable instance of what I am here
speaking.&mdash;This extraordinary person, amidst the civil wars of
his country, when he saw the designs of all parties equally tended
to the subvention of liberty, by constantly preserving the esteem
and affection of both the competitors, found means to serve his
friends on either side: and while he sent money to young
<i>Marius</i>, whose father was declared an enemy of the
commonwealth, he was himself one of <i>Sylla's</i> chief
favourites, and always near that general.</p>
<p><b>30.</b> During the war between <i>C&aelig;sar</i> and
<i>Pompey</i>, he still maintained the same conduct. After the
death of C&aelig;sar, he sent money to <i>Brutus</i>, in his
troubles, and did a thousand good offices to <i>Anthony's</i> wife
and friends, when the party seemed ruined. Lastly, even in that
bloody war between <i>Anthony</i> and <i>Augustus</i>,
<i>Atticus</i> still kept his place in both their friendships;
insomuch, that the first, says <i>Cornelius Nepos</i>, whenever he
was absent from <i>Rome</i>, in any part of the empire, writ
punctually to him what he was doing, what he read, and whither he
intended to go; and the latter gave him constantly an exact account
of all his affairs.</p>
<p><b>31.</b> A likeness of inclinations in every particular is so
far from being requisite to form a benevolence in two minds towards
each other, as it is generally imagined, that I believe we shall
find some of the firmest friendships to have been contracted
between persons of different humours; the mind being often pleased
with those perfections which are new to it, and which it does not
find among its own accomplishments.</p>
<p><b>32.</b> Besides that a man in some measure supplies his own
defects, and fancies himself at second-hand possessed of those good
qualities and endowments, which are in the possession of him who in
the eye of the world is looked on as his other self.</p>
<p><b>33.</b> The most difficult province in friendship is the
letting a man see his faults and errors, which should, if possible,
be so contrived, that he may perceive our advice is given him not
so much to please ourselves, as for his own advantage. The
reproaches, therefore, of a friend, should always be strictly just,
and not too frequent.</p>
<p><b>34.</b> The violent desire of pleasing in the person reproved
may otherwise change into a despair of doing it, while he finds
himself censured for faults he is not conscious of. A mind that is
softened and humanized by friendship, cannot bear frequent
reproaches: either it must quite sink under the oppression, or
abate considerably of the value and esteem it had for him who
bestows them.</p>
<p><b>35.</b> The proper business of friendship is to inspire life
and courage; and a soul, thus supported, out-does itself; whereas
if it be unexpectedly deprived of those succours, it droops and
languishes.</p>
<p><b>36.</b> We are in some measure more inexcusable if we violate
our duties to a friend, than to a relation; since the former arise
from a voluntary choice, the latter from a necessity, to which we
could not give our own consent.</p>
<p><b>37.</b> As it has been said on one side, that a man ought not
to break with a faulty friend, that he may not expose the weakness
of his choice; it will doubtless hold much stronger with respect to
a worthy one, that he may never be upbraided for having lost so
valuable a treasure which was once in his possession.</p>

<h2><i>Detraction and Falsehood</i></h2>
<br>
<p><b>1.</b> I have not seen you lately at any of the places where
I visit, so that I am afraid you are wholly unacquainted with what
passes among my part of the world, who are, though I say it,
without controversy, the most accomplished and best bred in the
town.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> Give me leave to tell you, that I am extremely
discomposed when I hear scandal, and am an utter enemy to all
manner of detraction, and think it the greatest meanness that
people of distinction can be guilty of; however, it is hardly
possible to come into company, where you do not find them pulling
one another to pieces, and that from no other provocation but that
of hearing any one commended.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> Merit, both as to wit and beauty, is become no other
than the possession of a few trifling people's favor, which you
cannot possibly arrive at, if you have really any thing in you that
is deserving.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> What they would bring to pass is, to make all good and
evil consist in report, and with whisper, calumnies, and
impertinence, to have the conduct of those reports.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> By this means innocents are blasted upon their first
appearance in town: and there is nothing more required to make a
young woman the object of envy and hatred, than to deserve love and
admiration.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> This abominable endeavour to suppressor lessen every
thing that is praise-worthy, is as frequent among the men as women.
If I can remember what passed at a visit last night, it will serve
as an instance that the sexes are equally inclined to defamation,
with equal malice, with equal impotence.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> <i>Jack Triplett</i> came into my Lady <i>Airy</i>'s
about eight of the clock. You know the manner we sit at a visit,
and I need not describe the circle; but Mr. <i>Triplett</i> came
in, introduced by two tapers supported by a spruce servant, whose
hair is under a cap till my lady's candles are all lighted up, and
the hour of ceremony begins.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> I say <i>Jack Triplett</i> came in, and singing (for
he is really good company) 'Every feature, charming
creature,'&mdash;he went on. It is a most unreasonable thing that
people cannot go peaceably to see their friends, but these
murderers are let loose.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> Such a shape! such an air! what a glance was that as
her chariot passed by mine!&mdash;My lady herself interrupted him:
Pray, who is this fine thing?&mdash;I warrant, says another, 'tis
the creature I was telling your ladyship of just now.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> You were telling of? says <i>Jack</i>; I wish I had
been so happy as to have come in and heard you, for I have not
words to say what she is: but if an agreeable height, a modest air,
a virgin shame, and impatience of being beheld, amidst a blaze of
ten thousand charms&mdash;The whole room flew out&mdash;Oh, Mr.
<i>Triplett</i>! When Mrs. <i>Lofty</i>, a known prude, said she
believed she knew whom the gentleman meant; but she was, indeed, as
he civilly represented her, impatient of being beheld. Then turning
to the lady next her&mdash;The most unbred creature you ever
saw.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> Another pursued the discourse:&mdash;As unbred,
madam, as you may think her, she is extremely belied if she is the
novice she appears; she was last week at a ball till two in the
morning: Mr. <i>Triplett</i> knows whether he was the happy man
that took care of her home; but&mdash;This was followed by some
particular exception that each woman in the room made to some
peculiar grace or advantage; so that Mr. <i>Triplett</i> was beaten
from one limb and feature to another, till he was forced to resign
the whole woman.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> In the end, I took notice <i>Triplett</i> recorded
all this malice in his heart; and saw in his countenance, and a
certain waggish shrug, that he designed to repeat the conversation:
I therefore let the discourse die, and soon after took an occasion
to commend a certain gentleman of my acquaintance for a person of
singular modesty, courage, integrity, and withal, as a man of an
entertaining conversation, to which advantages he had a shape and
manner peculiarly graceful.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> Mr. <i>Triplett</i>, who is a woman's man, seemed to
hear me, with patience enough, commend the qualities of his mind;
he never heard, indeed, but that he was a very honest man, and no
fool; but for a fine gentleman, he must ask pardon. Upon no other
foundation than this, Mr. <i>Triplett</i> took occasion to give the
gentleman's pedigree, by what methods some part of the estate was
acquired, how much it was beholden to a marriage for the present
circumstances of it: after all, he could see nothing but a common
man in his person, his breeding or under-Standing.</p>
<p><b>14.</b> Thus, Mr. <i>Spectator</i>, this impertinent humour
of diminishing every one who is produced in conversation to their
advantage, runs through the world; and I am, I confess, so fearful
of the force of ill tongues, that I have begged of all those who
are my well-wishers, never to commend me, for it will but bring my
frailties into examination, and I had rather be unobserved, than
conspicuous for disputed perfections.</p>
<p><b>15.</b> I am confident a thousand young people, who would
have been ornaments to society, have, from fear of scandal, never
dared to exert themselves in the polite arts of life.&mdash;Their
lives have passed away in an odious rusticity, in spite of great
advantages of person, genius and fortune.</p>
<p><b>16.</b> There is a vicious terror of being blamed in some
well-inclined people, and a wicked pleasure in suppressing them in
others; both which I recommend to your spectatorial wisdom to
animadvert upon: and if you can be successful in it, I need not say
how much you will deserve of the town; but new toasts will owe to
you their beauty, and new wits their fame.</p>
<p><b>17.</b> Truth and reality have all the advantages of
appearance, and many more. If the show of any thing be good for any
thing, I am sure sincerity is better: for why does any man
dissemble, or seem to be that which he is not, but because he
thinks it good to have such a quality as he pretends to? for to
counterfeit and dissemble, is to put on the appearance of some real
excellency.</p>
<p><b>18.</b> Now the best way in the world for a man to seem to be
any thing, is really to be what he would seem to be. Besides that,
it is many times as troublesome to make good the pretence of a good
quality, as to have it; and if a man have it not, it is ten to one
but he is discovered to want it, and then all his pains and labour
to seem to have it, is lost. There is something unnatural in
painting, which a skilful eye will easily discern from native
beauty and complexion.</p>
<p><b>19.</b> It is hard to personate and act a part long; for
where truth is not at the bosom; nature will always be endeavouring
to return, and will peep out and betray herself one time or other.
Therefore, if any man think it convenient to seem good, let him be
so indeed, and then his goodness will appear to every body's
satisfaction; so that upon all accounts sincerity is true
wisdom.</p>
<p><b>20.</b> Particularly as to the affairs of this world,
integrity hath many advantages over all the fine and artificial
ways of dissimulation and deceit; it is much the plainer and
easier, much the safer and more secure way of dealing in the world;
it has less of trouble and difficulty, of entanglement and
perplexity, of danger and hazard in it: it is the shortest and
nearest way to our end, carrying us thither in a straight line, and
will hold out and last longest.</p>
<p><b>21.</b> The arts of deceit and cunning do continually grow
weaker and less effectual and serviceable to them that use them;
whereas integrity gains strength by use, and the more and longer
any man practiseth it, the greater service it does him, by
confirming his reputation, and encouraging those with whom he hath
to do, to repose the greatest trust and confidence in him, which is
an unspeakable advantage in the business and affairs of life.</p>
<p><b>22.</b> Truth is always consistent with itself, and needs
nothing to help it out; it is always near at hand, and sits upon
our lips, and is ready to drop out before we are aware; whereas a
lie is troublesome, and sets a man's invention upon the rack, and
one trick needs a great many more to make it good.</p>
<p><b>23.</b> It is like building upon a false foundation, which
continually stands in need of props to shoar it up, and proves at
last more chargeable, than to have raised a substantial building at
first upon a true and solid foundation; for sincerity is firm and
substantial, and there is nothing hollow and unsound in it, and
because it is plain and open, fears no discovery:</p>
<p><b>24.</b> Of which the crafty man is always in danger, and when
he thinks he walks in the dark, all his pretences are so
transparent, that he who runs may read them; he is the last man
that finds himself to be found out, and whilst he takes it for
granted that he makes fools of others, he renders himself
ridiculous.</p>
<p><b>25.</b> Add to all this, that sincerity is the most
compendious wisdom, and an excellent instrument for the speedy
dispatch of business; it creates confidence in those we have to
deal with, saves the labor of many inquiries, and brings things to
an issue in a few words.</p>
<p><b>26.</b> It is like travelling; in a plain beaten road, which
commonly brings a man sooner to his journey's end than by-ways, in
which men often lose themselves. In a word, whatsoever convenience
may be thought to be in falsehood and dissimulation, it is soon
over, but the inconvenience of it is perpetual, because it brings a
man under an everlasting jealousy and suspicion, so that he is not
believed when he speaks truth, nor trusted when perhaps he means
honestly; when a man hath once forfeited the reputation of his
integrity, he is set last, and nothing will then serve his turn,
neither truth nor falsehood.</p>
<p><b>27.</b> And I have often thought, that God hath, in his great
wisdom, hid from men of false and dishonest minds, the wonderful
advantages of truth and integrity to the prosperity even of our
worldly affairs; these men are so blinded by their covetousness and
ambition, that they cannot look beyond a present advantage, nor
forbear to seize upon it, though by ways never so indirect; they
cannot see so far, as to the remote consequences of a steady
integrity, and the vast benefit and advantages which it will bring
a man at last.</p>
<p><b>28.</b> Were but this sort of men wise and clear sighted
enough to discern this, they would be honest out of very knavery;
not out of any love to honesty and virtue, but with a crafty design
to promote and advance more effectually their own interests; and
therefore the justice of the Divine Providence hath hid this truest
point of wisdom from their eyes, that bad men might not be upon
equal terms with the just and upright, and serve their own wicked
designs by honest and lawful means.</p>
<p><b>29.</b> Indeed if a man were only to deal in the world for a
day, and should never have occasion to converse more with mankind,
never more need their good opinion or good word, it were then no
great matter (speaking as to the concernments of this world) if a
man spent his reputation all at once, or ventured it at one
throw.</p>
<p><b>30.</b> But if he be to continue in the world, and would have
the advantage of conversation while he is in it, let him make use
of truth and sincerity in all his words and actions; for nothing
but this will last and hold out to the end; all other arts will
fail, but truth and integrity will carry a man through, and bear
him out to the last.</p>
<p><b>31.</b> When <i>Aristotle</i> was once asked, what a man
could gain by uttering falsehoods? he replied, "not to be credited
when he shall tell the truth."</p>
<p>The character of a lyar is at once so hateful and contemptible,
that even of those who have lost their virtue it might be expected,
that from the violation of truth they should be restrained by their
pride. Almost every other vice that disgraces human nature, may be
kept in countenance by applause and association.</p>
<p><b>32.</b> The corrupter of virgin innocence sees himself envied
by the men, and at least not detested by the women: the drunkard
may easily unite with beings, devoted like himself to noisy
merriment or silent insensibility, who will celebrate his victories
over the novices of intemperance, boast themselves the companions
of his prowess, and tell with rapture of the multitudes whom
unsuccessful emulation has hurried to the grave: even the robber
and the cut-throat have their followers, who admire their address
and intrepidity, their stratagems of rapine, and their fidelity to
the gang.</p>
<p><b>33.</b> The lyar, and only the lyar, is invariably and
universally despised, abandoned and disowned: he has no domestic
consolations, which he can oppose to the censure of mankind; he can
retire to no fraternity where his crimes may stand in the place of
virtues, but is given up to the hisses of the multitude, without
friend and without apologist. It is the peculiar condition of
falsehood, to be equally detested by the good and bad: "The
devils," says Sir <i>Thomas Brown</i>, "do not tell lies to one
another; for truth is necessary to all societies; nor can the
society of hell subsist without it."</p>
<p><b>34.</b> It is natural to expect, that a crime thus generally
detested, should be generally avoided; at least that none should
expose himself to unabated and unpitied infamy, without an adequate
temptation; and that to guilt so easily detected, and so severely
punished, an adequate temptation would not readily be found.</p>
<p><b>35.</b> Yet so it is, that in defiance of censure and
contempt, truth is frequently violated; and scarcely the most
vigilant unremitted circumspection will secure him that mixes with
mankind, from being hourly deceived by men of whom it can scarcely
be imagined, that they mean an injury to him or profit to
themselves; even where the subject of conversation could not have
been expected to put the passions in motion, or to have excited
either hope or fear, or zeal or malignity, sufficient to induce any
man to put his reputation in hazard, however little he might value
it, or to overpower the love of truth, however weak might be its
influence.</p>
<p><b>36.</b> The casuists have very diligently distinguished lies
into their several classes, according to their various degrees of
malignity; but they have, I think, generally omitted that which is
most common, and, perhaps, not less mischievous; which, since the
moralists have not given it a name, I shall distinguish as the lie
of vanity.</p>
<p>To vanity may justly be imputed most of the falsehoods which
every man perceives hourly playing upon his ear, and perhaps most
of those that are propagated with success.</p>
<p><b>37.</b> To the lie of commerce, and the lie of malice, the
motive is so apparent, that they are seldom negligently or
implicitly received: suspicion is always watchful over the
practices of interest; and whatever the hope of gain, or desire of
mischief, can prompt one man to assert, another is, by reasons
equally cogent, incited to refute. But vanity pleases herself with
such slight gratifications, and looks forward to pleasure so
remotely consequential, that her practices raise no alarm, and her
stratagems are not easily discovered.</p>
<p><b>38.</b> Vanity is, indeed, often suffered to pass unpursued
by suspicion; because he that would watch her motions, can never be
at rest; fraud and malice are bounded in their influence; some
opportunity of time and place is necessary to their agency; but
scarce any man is abstracted one moment from his vanity; and he, to
whom truth affords no gratifications, is generally inclined to seek
them in falsehoods.</p>
<p><b>39.</b> It is remarked by Sir <i>Kenelm Digby</i>, "that
every man has a desire to appear superior to others, though it were
only in having seen what they have not seen."</p>
<p>Such an accidental advantage, since it neither implies merit,
nor confers dignity, one would think should not be desired so much
as to be counterfeited; yet even this vanity, trifling as it is,
produces innumerable narratives, all equally false, but more or
less credible, in proportion to the skill or confidence of the
relater.</p>
<p><b>40.</b> How many may a man of diffusive conversation count
among his acquaintances, whose lives have been signalized by
numberless escapes; who never cross the river but in a storm, or
take a journey into the country without more adventures than befel
the knight-errants of ancient times in pathless forests or
enchanted castles! How many must he know, to whom portents and
prodigies are of daily occurrence; and for whom nature is hourly
working wonders invisible to every other eye, only to supply them
with subjects of conversation!</p>
<p><b>41.</b> Others there are who amuse themselves with the
dissemination of falsehood, at greater hazard of detection and
disgrace; men marked out by some lucky planet for universal
confidence and friendship, who have, been consulted in every
difficulty, entrusted with every secret, and summoned to every
transaction: it is the supreme felicity of these men, to stun all
companies with noisy information; to still doubt, and overbear
opposition, with certain knowledge or authentic intelligence.</p>
<p><b>42.</b> A lyar of this kind, with a strong memory or brisk
imagination, is often the oracle of an obscure club, and, till time
discovers his impostures, dictates to his hearers with uncontrolled
authority: for if a public question be started, he was present at
the debate; if a new fashion be mentioned, he was at court the
first day of its appearance; if a new performance of literature
draws the attention of the public, he has patronized the author,
and seen his work in manuscript; if a criminal of eminence be
condemned to die, he often predicted his fate, and endeavoured his
reformation; and who that lives at a distance from the scene of
action, will dare to contradict a man, who reports from his own
eyes and ears, and to whom all persons and affairs are thus
intimately known?</p>
<p><b>45.</b> This kind of falsehood is generally successful for a
time, because it is practised at first with timidity and caution;
but the prosperity of the lyar is of short duration; the reception
of one story is always an incitement to the forgery of another less
probable; and he goes on to triumph over tacit credulity, till
pride or reason rises up against him, and his companions will no
longer endure to see him wiser than themselves.</p>
<p><b>44.</b> It is apparent, that the inventors of all these
fictions intend some exaltation of themselves, and are led off by
the pursuit of honour from their attendance upon truth: their
narratives always imply some consequence in favor of their courage,
their sagacity, or their activity, their familiarity with the
learned, or their reception among the great; they are always bribed
by the present pleasure of seeing themselves superior to those that
surround them, and receiving the homage of silent attention and
envious admiration.</p>
<p><b>45.</b> But vanity is sometimes excited to fiction by less
visible gratifications: the present age abounds with a race of
lyars who are content with the consciousness of falsehood, and
whose pride is to deceive others without any gain or glory to
themselves. Of this tribe it is the supreme pleasure to remark a
lady in the play-house or the park, and to publish, under the
character of a man suddenly enamoured, an advertisement in the news
of the next day, containing a minute description of her person and
her dress.</p>
<p><b>46.</b> From this artifice, however, no other effect can be
expected, than perturbations which the writer can never see, and
conjectures of which he can never be informed: some mischief,
however, he hopes he has done; and to have done mischief is of some
importance. He sets his invention to work again, and produces a
narrative of a robbery, or a murder, with all the circumstances of
the time and place accurately adjusted. This is a jest of greater
effect and longer duration. If he fixes his scene at a proper
distance, he may for several days keep a wife in terror for her
husband, or a mother for her son; and please himself with
reflecting, that by his abilities and address some addition is made
to the miseries of life.</p>
<p><b>47.</b> There is, I think, an ancient law in <i>Scotland</i>,
by which <i>Leasing-making</i> was capitally punished. I am,
indeed, far from desiring to increase in this kingdom the number of
executions; yet I cannot but think, that they who destroy the
confidence of society, weaken the credit of intelligence, and
interrupt the security of life; harrass the delicate with shame,
and perplex the timorous with alarms; might very properly be
awakened to a sense of their crimes, by denunciations of a
whipping-post or a pillory: since many are so insensible of right
and wrong, that they have no standard of action but the law; nor
feel guilt, but as they dread punishment.</p>

<br>
<a name='The_Importance_of_Punctuality' id=
"The_Importance_of_Punctuality"></a>
<h2><i>The Importance of Punctuality</i>.</h2>
<br>
<p><b>1.</b> It is observed in the writings of <i>Boyle</i>, that
the excellency of manufactures and the facility of labor would be
much promoted, if the various expedients and contrivances which lie
concealed in private hands, were, by reciprocal communications,
made generally known; for there are few operations that are not
performed by one or other with some peculiar advantages, which,
though singly of little importance, would, by conjunction and
concurrence, open new inlets to knowledge, and give new powers to
diligence.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> There are in like manner several moral excellencies
distributed among the various classes of mankind, which he that
converses in the world should endeavor to assemble in himself. It
was said by the learned <i>Cajucius</i>, that he never read more
than one book, by which he was not instructed; and he that shall
inquire after virtue with ardour and attention, will seldom find a
man by whose example or sentiments he may not be improved.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> Every profession has some essential and appropriate
virtue, without which there can be no hope of honor or success, and
which, as it is more or less cultivated, confers within its sphere
of activity different degrees of merit and reputation. As the
astrologers range the subdivisions of mankind under the planets
which they suppose to influence their lives, the moralist may
distribute them according to the virtues which they necessarily
practise, and consider them as distinguished by prudence or
fortitude, diligence or patience.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> So much are the modes of excellence settled by time
and place, that man may be heard boasting in one street of that
which they would anxiously conceal in another. The grounds of scorn
and esteem, the topics of praise and satire, are varied according
to the several virtues or vices which the course of our lives has
disposed us to admire or abhor; but he who is solicitous for his
own improvement, must not suffer his affairs to be limited by local
reputation, but select from every tribe of mortals their
characteristical virtues, and constellate in himself the scattered
graces which shine single in other men.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> The chief praise to which a trader generally aspires,
is that of punctuality, or an exact and rigorous observance of
commercial promises and engagements; nor is there any vice of which
he so much dreads the imputation, as of negligence and instability.
This is a quality which the interest of mankind requires to be
diffused through all the ranks of life, but which, however useful
and valuable, many seem content to want: it is considered as a
vulgar and ignoble virtue, below the ambition of greatness, or
attention of wit, scarcely requisite among men of gaiety and
spirit, and sold at its highest rate when it is sacrificed to a
frolic or a jest.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> Every man has daily occasion to remark what vexations
and inconveniences arise from this privilege of deceiving one
another. The active and vivacious have so long disdained the
restraints of truth, that promises and appointments have lost their
cogency, and both parties neglect their stipulations, because each
concludes that they will be broken by the other.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> Negligence is first admitted in trivial affairs, and
strengthened by petty indulgences. He that is not yet hardened by
custom, ventures not on the violation of important engagements, but
thinks himself bound by his word in cases of property or danger,
though he allows himself to forget at what time he is to meet
ladies in the park, or at what tavern his friends are expecting
him.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> This laxity of honor would be more tolerable, if it
could be restrained to the play-house, the ball-room, or the card
table; yet even there it is sufficiently troublesome, and darkens
those moments with expectation, suspence, uncertainty and
resentment, which are set aside for the softer pleasures of life,
and from which we naturally hope for unmingled enjoyment, and total
relaxation. But he that suffers the slightest breach in his
morality, can seldom tell what shall enter it, or how wide it shall
be made; when a passage is opened, the influx of corruption is
every moment wearing down opposition, and by slow degrees deluges
the heart.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> <i>Aliger</i> entered into the world a youth of lively
imagination, extensive views, and untainted principles. His
curiosity incited him to range from place to place, and try all the
varieties of conversation; his elegance of address and fertility of
ideas gained him friends wherever he appeared; or at least he found
the general kindness of reception always shewn to a young man whose
birth and fortune gave him a claim to notice, and who has neither
by vice or folly destroyed his privileges.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> <i>Aliger</i> was pleased with this general smile of
mankind, and being naturally gentle and flexible, was industrious
to preserve it by compliance and officiousness, but did not suffer
his desire of pleasing to vitiate his integrity. It was his
established maxim, that a promise is never to be broken; nor was it
without long reluctance that he once suffered himself to be drawn
away from a festal engagement by the importunity of another
company.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> He spent the evening, as is usual in the rudiments of
vice, with perturbation and imperfect enjoyment, and met his
disappointed friends in the morning with confusion and excuses. His
companions, not accustomed to such scrupulous anxiety, laughed at
his uneasiness, compounded the offence for a bottle, gave him
courage to break his word again, and again levied the penalty.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> He ventured the same experiment upon another society;
and found them equally ready to consider it as a venial fault,
always incident to a man of quickness and gaiety; till by degrees
he began to think himself at liberty to follow the last invitation,
and was no longer shocked at the turpitude of falsehood. He made no
difficulty to promise his presence at distant places, and if
listlessness happened to creep upon him, would sit at home with
great tranquillity, and has often, while he sunk to sleep in a
chair, held ten tables in continual expectation of his
entrance.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> He found it so pleasant to live in perpetual vacancy,
that he soon dismissed his attention as an useless incumbrance, and
resigned himself to carelessness and dissipation, without any
regard to the future or the past, or any other motive of action
than the impulse of a sudden desire, or the attraction of immediate
pleasure. The absent were immediately forgotten, and the hopes or
fears of others had no influence upon his conduct. He was in
speculation completely just, but never kept his promise to a
creditor; he was benevolent, but always deceived those friends whom
he undertook to patronize or assist; he was prudent, but suffered
his affairs to be embarrassed for want of settling his accounts at
stated times.</p>
<p><b>14.</b> He courted a young lady, and when the settlements
were drawn, took a ramble into the country on the day appointed to
sign them. He resolved to travel, and sent his chests on
ship-board, but delayed to follow them till he lost his passage. He
was summoned as an evidence in a cause of great importance, and
loitered in the way till the trial was past. It is said, that when
he had with great expense formed an interest in a borough, his
opponent contrived by some agents, who knew his temper, to lure him
away on the day of election.</p>
<p><b>15.</b> His benevolence draws him into the commission of
thousand crimes, which others, less kind or civil, would escape.
His courtesy invites application, his promises produce dependence:
he has his pockets filled with petitions, which he intends some
time to deliver and enforce; and his table covered with letters of
request, with which he purposes to comply; but time slips
imperceptibly away, while he is either idle or busy: his friends
lose their opportunities, and charge upon him their miscarriages
and calamities.</p>
<p>This character, however contemptible, is not peculiar to
<i>Aliger</i>.</p>
<p><b>16.</b> They whose activity of imagination is often shifting
the scenes of expectation, are frequently subject to such sallies
of caprice as to make all their actions fortuitous, destroy the
value of their friendship, obstruct the efficacy of their virtues,
and set them below the meanest of those that persist in their
resolutions, execute what they design, and perform what they have
promised.</p>

<a name='Exercise___Temperance_the_best_Preservative_of_Health' id=
"Exercise___Temperance_the_best_Preservative_of_Health"></a>
<h2><i>Exercise &amp; Temperance the best Preservative of
Health.</i></h2>
<br>
<p><b>1.</b> Bodily labor is of two kinds, either that which a man
submits to for his livelihood, or that which he undergoes for his
pleasure. The latter of them generally changes the name of labor
for that of exercise, but differs only from ordinary labor as it
rises from another motive.</p>
<p>A country life abounds in both these kinds of labor, and for
that reason gives a man a greater stock of health, and consequently
a more perfect enjoyment of himself, than any other way of
life.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> I consider the body as a system of tubes and glands,
or, to use a more rustic phrase, a bundle of pipes and strainers,
fitted to one another after so wonderful a manner, as to make a
proper engine for the soul to work with. This description does not
only comprehend the bowels, bones, tendons, veins, nerves and
arteries, but every muscle and every ligature, which is a
composition of fibres, that are so many imperceptible tubes or
pipes interwoven on all sides with invisible glands or
strainers.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> This general idea of a human body, without considering
it in its niceties of anatomy, let us see how absolutely necessary
labor is for the right preservation of it. There must be frequent
motions and agitations, to mix, digest, and separate the juices
contained in it, as well as to clear and disperse the infinitude of
pipes and strainers of which it is composed, and to give their
solid parts a more firm and lasting tone. Labor or exercise
ferments the humors, casts them into their proper channels, throws
off redundancies, and helps nature in those secret distributions,
without which the body cannot subsist in its vigor, nor the soul
act with cheerfulness.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> I might here mention the effects which this has upon
all the faculties of the mind, by keeping the understanding clear,
the imagination untroubled, and refining those spirits that are
necessary for the proper exertion of our intellectual faculties,
during the present laws of union between soul and body. It is to a
neglect in this particular that we must ascribe the spleen, which
is so frequent in men of studious and sedentary tempers, as well as
the vapours to which those of the other sex are so often
subject.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> Had not exercise been absolutely necessary for our
well-being, nature would not have made the body so proper for it,
by giving such an activity to the limbs, and such a pliancy to
every part, as necessarily produce those compressions, extensions,
contortions, dilations, and all other kinds of motions that are
necessary for the preservation of such a system of tubes and glands
as has been before mentioned. And that we might not want
inducements to engage us in such an exercise of the body, as is
proper for its welfare, it is so ordered, that nothing, valuable
can be procured without it. Not to mention riches and honor, even
food and raiment are not to be come at without the toil of the
hands and sweat of the brows.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> Providence furnishes materials, but expects that we
should work them up ourselves. The earth must be labored before it
gives its increase, and when it is forced into its several
products, how many hands must they pass through before they are fit
for use. Manufactures, trade and agriculture, naturally employ more
than nineteen parts of the species in twenty; and as for those who
are not obliged to labor, by the condition in which they are born,
they are more miserable than the rest of mankind, unless they
indulge themselves in that voluntary labor which goes by the name
of exercise.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> My friend Sir <i>Roger</i> hath been an indefatigable
man in business of this kind, and has hung several parts of his
house with the trophies of his former labors. The walls of his
great hall are covered with the horns of several kinds of deer that
he has killed in the chase, which he thinks the most valuable
furniture of his house, as they afford him frequent topics of
discourse, and show that he has not been idle.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> At the lower end of the hall is a large otter's skin
stuffed with hay, which his mother ordered to be hung up in that
manner, and the knight looks upon it with great satisfaction,
because it seems he was but nine years old when his dog killed it.
A little room adjoining to the hall is a kind of arsenal, filled
with guns of several sizes and inventions, with which the knight
has made great havoc in the woods, and destroyed many thousands of
pheasants, partridges and woodcocks. His stable-doors are patched
with noses that belonged to foxes of the knight's own hunting
down.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> Sir <i>Roger</i> shewed me one of them that, for
distinction sake, has a brass nail stuck through it, which cost him
about fifteen hours riding, carried him, through half a dozen
counties, killed him a brace of geldings, and lost about half his
dogs. This the knight looks upon as one of the greatest exploits of
his life.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> The perverse widow, whom I have given some account
of, was the death of several foxes; for Sir <i>Roger</i> has told
me, that in the course of his amours he patched the western door of
his stable. Whenever the widow was cruel, the foxes were sure to
pay for it. In proportion as his passion for the widow abated and
old age came on, he left off fox-hunting; but a hare is not yet
safe that sits within ten miles of his house.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> There is no kind of exercise which I would so
recommend to my readers of both sexes as that of riding, as there
is none which so much conduces to health, and is every way
accommodated to the body, according to the idea which I have given
of it. Dr. <i>Sydenham</i> is very lavish in its praise; and if the
<i>English</i> reader will see the mechanical effects of it
described at length, he may find them in a book published not many
years since, under the title of <i>Medicina Gymnastica</i>.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> For my own part, when I am in town, for want of these
opportunities, I exercise myself an hour every morning upon a dumb
bell that is placed in a corner of my room, and pleases me the more
because it does everything I require in the most profound silence.
My landlady and her daughters are so well acquainted with my hours
of exercise, that they never come into my room to disturb me whilst
I am ringing.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> When I was some years younger than I am at present, I
used to employ myself in a more laborious diversion, which I
learned from a <i>Latin</i> treatise of exercise, that is written
with great erudition: It is there called the <i>Skimachia</i>, or
the fighting with a man's own shadow, and consists in the
brandishing of two short sticks grasped in each hand, and loaded
with plugs of lead at either end. This opens the chest, exercises
the limbs, and gives a man all the pleasure of boxing, without the
blows.</p>
<p><b>14.</b> I could wish that several learned men would lay out
that time which they employ in controversies, and disputes about
nothing, in <i>this method</i> of fighting with their own shadows.
It might conduce very much to evaporate the spleen, which makes
them uneasy to the public as well as to themselves.</p>
<p>As I am a compound of soul and body, I consider myself as
obliged to a double scheme of duties; and think I have not
fulfilled the business of the day when I do not thus employ the one
in labour and exercise, as well as the other in study and
contemplation.</p>
<p><b>15.</b> There is a story in the <i>Arabian Nights Tales</i>,
of a king who had long languished under an ill habit of body, and
had taken abundance of remedies to no purpose. At length, says the
fable, a physician cured him by the following method: He took an
hollow ball of wood, and filled it with several drugs; after which
he closed it up so artificially that nothing appeared. He likewise
took a mall, and after having hollowed the handle, and that part
which strikes the ball, inclosed in them several drugs after the
same manner as in the ball itself.</p>
<p><b>16.</b> He then ordered the sultan who was his patient, to
exercise himself early in the morning with these rightly prepared
instruments, till such time as he should sweat; when, as the story
goes, the virtue of the medicaments perspiring through the wood,
had so good an influence on the sultan's constitution, that they
cured him of an indisposition which all the compositions he had
taken inwardly had not been able to remove.</p>
<p><b>17.</b> This eastern allegory is finely contrived to shew us
how beneficial bodily labour is to health, and that exercise is the
most effectual physic. I have described in my hundred and fifteenth
paper, from the general structure and mechanism of an human body,
how absolutely necessary exercise is for its preservation; I shall
in this place recommend another great preservative of health, which
in many cases produces the same effects as exercise, and may, in
some measure, supply its place, where opportunities of exercise are
wanting.</p>
<p><b>18.</b> The preservative I am speaking of is temperance,
which has those particular advantages above all other means of
health, that it may be practised by all ranks and conditions, at
any season, or in any place. It is a kind of regimen into which
every man may put himself, without interruption to business,
expense of money, or loss of time. If exercise throws off all
superfluities, temperance prevents them: if exercise clears the
vessels, temperance neither satiates nor over-strains them; if
exercise raises proper ferments in the humours, and promotes the
circulation of the blood, temperance gives nature her full play,
and enables her to exert herself in all her force and vigour: if
exercise dissipates a growing distemper, temperance starves it.</p>
<p><b>19.</b> Physic, for the most part, is nothing else but the
substitute of exercise or temperance. Medicines are indeed
absolutely necessary in acute distempers, that cannot wait the slow
operations of these two great instruments of health: but did men
live in an habitual course of exercise and temperance, there would
be but little occasion for them. Accordingly we find that those
parts of the world are the most healthy, where they subsist by the
chase; and that men lived longest when their lives were employed in
hunting, and when they had little food besides what they
caught.</p>
<p><b>20.</b> Blistering, cupping, bleeding, are seldom of use to
any but the idle and intemperate; as all those inward applications,
which are so much in practice among us, are, for the most part,
nothing else but expedients to make luxury consistent with health.
The apothecary is perpetually employed in countermining the cook
and the vintner. It is said of <i>Diogenes</i>, that meeting a
young man who was going to a feast, he took him up in the street,
and carried him home to his friends, as one who was running into
imminent danger, had he not prevented him.</p>
<p><b>21.</b> What would that philosopher have said, had he been
present at the gluttony of a modern meal? Would not he have thought
the master of the family mad, and have begged his servant to tie
down his hands, had he seen him devour fowl, fish and flesh;
swallow oil and vinegar, wines and spices; throw down sallads of
twenty different herbs, sauces of an hundred ingredients,
confections and fruits of numberless sweets and flavours? What
unnatural motions and counter-ferments must such a medley of
intemperance produce in the body? For my part, when I behold a
fashionable table set out in all its magnificence, I fancy, that I
see gouts and dropsies, fevers and lethargies, with other
innumerable distempers, lying in ambuscade among the dishes.</p>
<p><b>22.</b> Nature delights in the most plain and simple diet.
Every animal but man keeps to one dish. Herbs are the food of this
species, fish of that, and flesh of a third. Man falls upon every
thing that comes in his way; not the smallest fruit or excrescence
of the earth, scarce a berry, or a mushroom can escape him.</p>
<p>It is impossible to lay down any determinate rule for
temperance, because what is luxury in one may be temperance in
another; but there are few that have lived any time in the world,
who are not judges of their own constitutions, so far as to know
what kinds and what proportions of food do best agree with
them.</p>
<p><b>23.</b> Were I to consider my readers as my patients, and to
prescribe such a kind of temperance as is accommodated to all
persons, and such as is particularly suitable to our climate and
way of living, I would copy the following rules of a very eminent
physician. Make your whole repast out of one dish. If you indulge
in a second, avoid drinking any thing strong till you have finished
your meal: at the same time abstain from all sauces, or at least
such as are not the most plain and simple.</p>
<p><b>24.</b> A man could not be well guilty of gluttony, if he
stuck to these few obvious and easy rules. In the first case, there
would be no variety of tastes to solicit his palate and occasion
excess; nor in the second, any artificial provocatives to relieve
satiety, and create a false appetite. Were I to prescribe a rule
for drinking, it should be formed on a saying quoted by Sir
<i>William Temple:&mdash;The first glass for myself, the second for
my friends, the third for good humour, and the fourth for my
enemies</i>. But because it is impossible for one who lives in the
world to diet himself always in so philosophical a manner, I think
every man should have his days of abstinence, according as his
constitution will permit.</p>
<p><b>25.</b> These are great reliefs to nature, as they qualify
her for struggling with hunger and thirst, whenever any distemper
or duty of life may put her upon such difficulties; and at the same
time give her an opportunity of extricating herself from her
oppressions, and recovering the several tones and springs of her
distended vessels. Besides that, abstinence well-timed often kills
a sickness in embryo, and destroys the first seeds of an
indisposition.</p>
<p><b>26.</b> It is observed by two or three ancient authors, that
<i>Socrates</i>, notwithstanding he lived in <i>Athens</i> during
that great plague, which has made so much noise through all ages,
and has been celebrated at different times by such eminent hands; I
say, notwithstanding that he lived in the time of this devouring
pestilence, he never caught the least infection, which those
writers unanimously ascribe to that uninterrupted temperance which
he always observed.</p>
<p><b>27.</b> And here I cannot but mention an observation which I
have often made, upon reading the lives of the philosophers, and
comparing them with any series of kings or great men of the same
number. If we consider these ancient sages, a great part of whose
philosophy consisted in a temperate and abstemious course of life,
one would think the life of a philosopher and the life of a man
were of two different dates. For we find that the generality of
these wise men were nearer an hundred than sixty years of age at
the time of their respective deaths.</p>
<p><b>28.</b> But the most remarkable instance of the efficacy of
temperance towards the procuring of long life, is what we meet with
in a little book published by <i>Lewis Cornaro</i>, the
<i>Venetian</i>; which I the rather mention, because it is of
undoubted credit, as the late <i>Venetian</i> ambassador, who was
of the same family, attested more than once in conversation, when
he resided in <i>England</i>. <i>Cornaro</i>, who was the author of
the little treatise I am mentioning, was of an infirm constitution,
till about forty, when, by obstinately persisting in an exact
course of temperance, he recovered a perfect state of health;
insomuch that at fourscore he published his book, which has been
translated into <i>English</i>, under the title of, <i>Sure and
certain methods of attaining a long and healthy Life</i>.</p>
<p><b>29.</b> He lived to give a third or fourth edition of it, and
after having passed his hundredth year, died without pain or agony,
and like one who falls asleep. The treatise I mention has been
taken notice of by several eminent authors, and is written with
such a spirit of cheerfulness, religion and good sense, as are the
natural concomitants of temperance and sobriety. The mixture of the
old man in it is rather a recommendation than a discredit to
it.</p>
<br>
<br>
<a name='The_Duty_of_Secrecy' id="The_Duty_of_Secrecy"></a>
<h2><i>The Duty of Secrecy.</i></h2>
<br>
<p><b>1.</b> It is related by <i>Quintus Curtius</i>, that the
<i>Persians</i> always conceived a lasting and invincible contempt
of a man who had violated the laws of secrecy: for they thought
that, however he might be deficient in the qualities requisite to
actual excellence, the negative virtues at least were always in his
power, and though he perhaps could not speak well if he was to try,
it was still easy for him not to speak.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> In this opinion of the easiness of secrecy, they seem
to have considered it as opposed, not to treachery, but loquacity,
and to have conceived the man, whom they thus censured, not
frighted by menaces to reveal, or bribed by promises to betray, but
incited by the mere pleasure of talking, or some other motive
equally trivial, to lay open his heart with reflection, and to let
whatever he knew slip from him, only for want of power to retain
it.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> Whether, by their settled and avowed scorn of
thoughtless talkers, the <i>Persians</i> were able to diffuse to
any great extent, the virtue of taciturnity, we are hindered by the
distress of those times from being able to discover, there being
very few memoirs remaining of the court of <i>Persepolis</i>, nor
any distinct accounts handed down to us of their office-clerks,
their ladies of the bed-chamber, their attornies, their
chamber-maids, or the foot-men.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> In these latter ages, though the old animosity against
a prattler is still retained, it appears wholly to have lost its
effects upon the conduct of mankind; for secrets are so seldom
kept, that it may with some reason be doubted, whether the ancients
were not mistaken in their first postulate, whether the quality of
retention be so generally bestowed, and whether a secret has not
some subtile volatility, by which it escapes almost imperceptibly
at the smallest vent; or some power of fermentation, by which it
expands itself so as to burst the heart that will not give it
way.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> Those that study either the body or the mind of man,
very often find the most specious and pleasing theory falling under
the weight of contrary experience: and instead of gratifying their
vanity by inferring effects from causes, they are always reduced at
last to conjecture causes from effects. That it is easy to be
secret, the speculatist can demonstrate in his retreat, and
therefore thinks himself justified in placing confidence: the man
of the world knows, that, whether difficult or not, it is not
uncommon, and therefore finds himself rather inclined to search
after the reason of this universal failure in one of the most
important duties of society.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> The vanity of being known to be trusted with a secret
is generally one of the chief motives to disclose it; for however
absurd it may be thought to boast an honour, by an act that shews
that it was conferred without merit, yet most men seem rather
inclined to confess the want of virtue than of importance, and more
willingly shew their influence and their power, though at the
expence of their probity, than glide through life with no other
pleasure than the private consciousness of fidelity: which, while
it is preserved, must be without praise, except from the single
person who tries and knows it.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> There are many ways of telling a secret, by which a
man exempts himself from the reproaches of his conscience, and
gratifies his pride without suffering himself to believe that he
impairs his virtue. He tells the private affairs of his patron or
his friend, only to those from whom he would not conceal his own;
he tells them to those who have no temptation to betray their
trust, or with the denunciation of a certain forfeiture of his
friendship, if he discovers that they become public.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> Secrets are very frequently told in the first ardour
of kindness, or of love, for the sake of proving by so important a
sacrifice, the sincerity of professions, or the warmth of
tenderness; but with this motive, though it be sometimes strong in
itself, vanity generally concurs, since every man naturally desires
to be most esteemed by those whom he loves, or whom he converses,
with whom he passes his hours of pleasure, and to whom he retires
from business and from care.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> When the discovery of secrets is under consideration,
there is always a distinction carefully to be made between our own
and those of another, those of which we are fully masters as they
affect only our own interest, and those which are deposited with us
in trust, and involve the happiness or convenience of such as we
have no right to expose to hazard by experiments upon their lives,
without their consent. To tell our own secrets is generally folly,
but that folly is without guilt; to communicate those with which we
are entrusted is always treachery, and treachery for the most part
combined with folly.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> There have, indeed, been some enthusiastic and
irrational zealots for friendship, who have maintained; and perhaps
believed that one friend has a right to all that is in possession
of another; and that therefore it is a violation of kindness to
exempt any secret from this boundless confidence; accordingly a
late female minister of state has been shameless enough to inform
the world, that she used, when she wanted to extract any thing from
her sovereign, to remind her of <i>Montaigne</i>'s reasoning, who
has determined, that to tell a secret to a friend is no breach of
fidelity, because the number of persons trusted is not multiplied,
a man and his friend being virtually the same.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> That such fallacy could be imposed upon any human
understanding, or that an author could have been imagined to
advance a position so remote from truth and reason any otherwise
than as a declaimer to shew to what extent he could stretch his
imagination, and with what strength he could press his principle,
would scarcely have been credible, had not this lady kindly shewed
us how far weakness may be deluded, or indolence amused.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> But since it appears, that even this sophistry has
been able, with the help of a strong desire to repose in quiet upon
the understanding of another, to mislead honest intentions, and an
understanding not contemptible, it may not be superfluous to
remark, that those things which are common among friends are only
such as either possesses in his own right, and can alienate or
destroy without injury to any other person. Without this
limitation, confidence must run on without end, the second person
may tell the secret to the third upon the same principle as he
received it from the first, and the third may hand it forward to a
fourth, till at last it is told in the round of friendship to them
from whom it was the first intention chiefly to conceal it.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> The confidence which <i>Caius</i> has of the
faithfulness of <i>Titius</i> is nothing more than an opinion which
himself cannot know to be true, and which <i>Claudius</i>, who
first tells his secret to <i>Caius</i>, may know, at least may
suspect to be false; and therefore the trust is transferred by
<i>Caius</i>, if he reveal what has been told him, to one from whom
the person originally concerned would probably have withheld it;
and whatever may be the event, <i>Caius</i> has hazarded the
happiness of his friend, without necessity and without permission,
and has put that trust in the hand of fortune was given only to
virtue.</p>
<p><b>14.</b> All the arguments upon which a man who is telling the
private affairs of another may ground his confidence in security,
he must upon reflection know to be uncertain, because he finds them
without effect upon himself. When he is imagining that
<i>Titius</i> will be cautious from a regard to his interest, his
reputation, or his duty, he ought to reflect that he is himself at
that instant acting in opposition to all these reasons, and
revealing what interest, reputation and duty direct him to
conceal.</p>
<p><b>15.</b> Every one feels that he should consider the man
incapable of trust, who believed himself at liberty to tell
whatever he knew to the first whom he should conclude deserving of
his confidence: therefore <i>Caius</i>, in admitting <i>Titius</i>
to the affairs imparted only to himself, violates his faith, since
he acts contrary to the intention of <i>Claudius</i>, to whom that
faith was given. For promises of friendship are, like all others,
useless and vain, unless they are made in some known sense,
adjusted and acknowledged by both parties.</p>
<p><b>16.</b> I am not ignorant that many questions may be started
relating to the duty of secrecy, where the affairs are of public
concern; where subsequent reasons may arise to alter the appearance
and nature of the trust; that the manner in which the secret was
told may change the degree of obligation; and that the principles
upon which a man is chosen for a confidant may not always equally
constrain him.</p>
<p><b>17.</b> But these scruples, if not too intricate, are of too
extensive consideration for my present purpose, nor are they such
as generally occur in common life; and though casuistical knowledge
be useful in proper hands, yet it ought by no means to be
carelessly exposed, since most will use it rather to lull than
awaken their own consciences; and the threads of reasoning, on
which truth is suspended, are frequently drawn to such subtility,
that common eyes cannot perceive, and common sensibility cannot
feel them.</p>
<p><b>18.</b> The whole doctrine as well as practice of secrecy is
so perplexing and dangerous, that, next to him who is compelled to
trust, I think him unhappy who is chosen to be trusted; for he is
often involved in scruples without the liberty of calling in the
help of any other understanding; he is frequently drawn into guilt,
under the appearance of friendship and honesty; and sometimes
subjected to suspicion by the treachery of others, who are engaged
without his knowledge in the same schemes; for he that has one
confidant has generally more, and when he is at last betrayed, is
in doubt on whom he shall fix the crime.</p>
<p><b>19.</b> The rules therefore that I shall propose concerning
secrecy, and from which I think it not safe to deviate, without
long and exact deliberation, are&mdash;never to solicit the
knowledge of a secret. Not willingly nor without any limitations,
to accept such confidence when it is offered. When a secret is once
admitted, to consider the trust as of a very high nature, important
to society, and sacred as truth, and therefore not to be violated
for any incidental convenience, or slight appearance of contrary
fitness.</p>
<br>
<br>
<a name='Of_Cheerfulness' id="Of_Cheerfulness"></a>
<h2><i>Of Cheerfulness.</i></h2>
<br>
<p><b>1.</b> I have always preferred cheerfulness to mirth. The
latter I consider as an act, the former as a habit of the mind.
Mirth is short and transient, cheerfulness fixed and permanent.
Those are often raised into the greatest transports of mirth, who
are subject to the greatest depressions of melancholy; on the
contrary, cheerfulness, though it does not give the mind such an
exquisite gladness, prevents us from falling into any depths of
sorrow. Mirth is like a flash of lightning that breaks through a
gloom of clouds, and glitters for a moment; cheerfulness keeps up a
kind of day-light in the mind, and fills it with a steady and
perpetual serenity.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> Men of austere principles look upon mirth as too
wanton and dissolute for a state of probation, and as filled with a
certain triumph and insolence of heart that is inconsistent with a
life Which is every moment obnoxious to the greatest dangers.
Writers of this complexion have observed, that the sacred person
who was the great pattern of perfection, was never seen to
laugh.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> Cheerfulness of mind is not liable to any of these
exceptions; it is of a serious and composed nature; it does not
throw the mind into a condition improper for the present state of
humanity, and is very conspicuous in the characters of those who
are looked upon as the greatest philosophers among the heathens, as
well as among those who have been deservedly esteemed as saints and
holy men among christians.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> If we consider cheerfulness in three lights, with
regard to ourselves, to those we converse with, and to the great
Author of our being, it will not a little recommend itself on each
of these accounts. The man who is in possession of this excellent
frame of mind, is not only easy in his thoughts, but a perfect
master of all the powers and faculties of the soul: his imagination
is always clear, and his judgment undisturbed: his temper is even
and unruffled, whether in action or solitude. He comes with a
relish to all those goods which nature has provided for him, tastes
all the pleasures of the creation which are poured about him, and
does not feel the full weight of those accidental evils which may
befal him.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> If we consider him in relation to the persons whom he
converses with, it naturally produces love and good will towards
him. A cheerful mind is not only disposed to be affable and
obliging, but raises the same good humour in those who come within
its influence. A man finds himself pleased, he does not know why,
with the cheerfulness of his companion: it is like a sudden
sun-shine that awakens a secret delight in the mind, without her
attending to it. The heart rejoices of its own accord, and
naturally flows out into friendship and benevolence towards the
person who has so kindly an effect upon it.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> When I consider this cheerful stale of mind in its
third relation, I cannot but look upon it as a constant habitual
gratitude to the great Author of Nature. An inward cheerfulness is
an implicit praise and thanksgiving to Providence under all its
dispensations. It is a kind of acquiescence in the state wherein we
are placed, and a secret approbation of the Divine will in his
conduct towards man.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> There are but two things which, in my opinion, can
reasonably deprive us of this cheerfulness of heart. The first of
these is the sense of guilt. A man who lives in a state of vice and
impenitence, can have no title to that evenness and tranquility of
mind which is the health of the soul, and the natural effect of
virtue and innocence. Cheerfulness in an ill man, deserves a harder
name than language can furnish us with, and is many degrees beyond
what we commonly call folly or madness.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> Atheism, by which I mean a disbelief of a Supreme
Being, and consequently of a future state, under whatsoever title
it shelters itself, may likewise very reasonably deprive a man of
this cheerfulness of temper. There is something so particularly
gloomy and offensive to human nature in the prospect of
non-existence, that I cannot but wonder, with many excellent
writers, how it is possible for a man to out-live the expectation
of it. For my own part, I think the being of a God is so little to
be doubted, that it is almost the only truth we are sure of, and
such a truth as we meet with in every object, in every occurrence,
and in every thought.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> If we look into the characters of this tribe of
infidels, we generally find they are made up of pride, spleen and
cavil: It is indeed no wonder that men, who are uneasy to
themselves, should be so to the rest of the world; and how is it
possible for a man to be otherwise than uneasy in himself, who is
in danger every moment of losing his entire existence, and dropping
into nothing?</p>
<p><b>10.</b> The vicious man and atheist have therefore no
pretence to cheerfulness, and would act very unreasonably, should
they endeavor after it. It is impossible for any one to live in
good humour, and enjoy his present existence, who is apprehensive
either of torment or of annihilation; of being miserable, or of not
being at all.</p>
<p>After having mentioned these two great principles, which are
destructive of cheerfulness in their own nature, as well as in
right reason, I cannot think of any other that ought to banish this
happy temper from a virtuous mind. Pain and sickness, shame and
reproach, poverty and old age, nay, death itself, considering the
shortness of their duration, and the advantage we may reap from
them, do not deserve the name of evils.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> A good mind may bear up under them with fortitude,
with indolence, and with cheerfulness of heart&mdash;the tossing of
a tempest does not discompose him, which he is sure will bring him
to a joyful harbour.</p>
<p>A man who uses his best endeavours to live according to the
dictates of virtue and right reason, has two perpetual sources of
cheerfulness, in the consideration of his own nature, and of that
Being on whom he has a dependence.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> If he looks into himself, he cannot but rejoice in
that existence, which is so lately bestowed upon him, and which,
after millions of ages, will still be new, and still in its
beginning; How many self-congratulations naturally arise in the
mind, when it reflects on this its entrance into eternity, when it
takes a view of those improveable faculties, which in a few years,
and even at its first setting out, have made so considerable a
progress, and which will be still receiving an increase of
perfection, and consequently an increase of happiness?</p>
<p><b>13.</b> The consciousness of such a being spreads a perpetual
diffusion of joy through the soul of a virtuous man, and makes him
look upon himself every moment as more happy than he knows how to
conceive.</p>
<p>The second source of cheerfulness to a good mind is, its
consideration of that Being on whom we have our dependence, and in
whom, though we behold him as yet but in the first faint
discoveries of his perfections, we see every thing that we can
imagine as great, glorious, or amiable. We find ourselves every
where upheld by his goodness, and surrounded by an immensity of
love and mercy.</p>
<p><b>14.</b> In short, we depend upon a Being, whose power
qualifies him to make us happy by an infinity of means, whose
goodness and truth engage him to make those happy who desire it of
him, and whose unchangeableness will secure us in this happiness to
all eternity.</p>
<p>Such considerations, which every one should perpetually cherish
in his thoughts, will banish from us all that secret heaviness of
heart which unthinking men are subject to when they lie under no
real affliction, all that anguish which we may feel from any evil
that actually oppresses us, to which I may likewise add those
little cracklings of mirth and folly, that are apter to betray
virtue than support it; and establish in us such an even and
cheerful temper, as makes us pleasing to ourselves, to those with
whom we converse, and to him whom we are made to please.</p>

<h2><i>On the Advantages of a Cheerful Temper</i>.</h2>
<div style='text-align: right; margin-right: 10%;'>[SPECTATOR, No.
387.]</div>
<br>
<p><b>1.</b> Cheerfulness is in the first place the best promoter
of health. Repining and secret murmurs of heart give imperceptible
strokes to those delicate fibres of which the vital parts are
composed, and wear out the machine insensibly; not to mention those
violent ferments which they stir up in the blood, and those
irregular disturbed motions, which they raise in the animal
spirits.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> I scarce remember in my own observation, to have met
with many old men, or with such, who (to use our <i>English</i>
phrase) <i>were well</i>, that had not at least a certain indolence
in their humour, if not a more than ordinary gaiety and
cheerfulness of heart. The truth of it is, health and cheerfulness
mutually beget each other; with this difference, that we seldom
meet with a great degree of health which is not attended with a
certain cheerfulness, but very often see cheerfulness where there
is no great degree of health.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> Cheerfulness bears the same friendly regard to the
mind as to the body: it banishes all anxious care and discontent,
soothes and composes the passions, and keeps the soul in a
perpetual calm. But, having already touched on this last
consideration, I shall here take notice, that the world in which we
are placed is filled with innumerable objects that are proper to
raise and keep alive this happy temper of mind.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> If we consider the world in its subserviency to man,
one would think it was made for our use; but if we consider it in
its natural beauty and harmony, one would be apt to conclude it was
made for our pleasure. The sun, which is as the great soul of the
universe, and produces all the necessaries of life, has a
particular influence in cheering the mind of man; and making the
heart glad.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> Those several living creatures which are made for our
service or sustenance, at the same time either fill the woods with
their music, furnish us with game, or raise pleasing ideas in us by
the delightfulness of their appearance. Fountains, lakes and
rivers, are as refreshing to the imagination as to the soul through
which they pass.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> There are writers of great distinction, who have made
it an argument for Providence, that the whole earth is covered with
green, rather than with any other colour, as being such a right
mixture of light and shade, that it comforts and strengthens the
eye instead of weakening or grieving it. For this reason several
painters have a green cloth hanging near them, to ease the eye upon
after too great an application to their colouring.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> A famous modern philosopher accounts for it in the
following manner:&mdash;All colours that are more luminous,
overpower and dissipate the animal spirits which are employed
insight: on the contrary, those that are more obscure do not give
the animal spirits a sufficient exercise; whereas the rays that
produce in us the idea of green, fall upon the eye in such a due
proportion, that they give the animal spirits their proper play,
and by keeping up the struggle in a just balance, excite a very
agreeable and pleasing sensation. Let the cause be what it will,
the effect is certain; for which reason, the poets ascribe to this
particular colour the epithet of <i>cheerful</i>.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> To consider further this double end in the works of
nature; and how they are, at the same time, both useful and
entertaining, we find that the most important parts in the
vegetable world are those which are the most beautiful. These are
the seeds by which the several races of plants are propagated and
continued, and which are always lodged in flowers or blossoms.
Nature seems to hide her principal design, and to be industrious in
making the earth gay and delightful, while she is carrying on her
great work, and intent upon her own preservation. The husbandman,
after the same manner, is employed in laying out the whole country
into a kind of garden or landscape, and making every thing smile
about him, whilst, in reality, he thinks of nothing but of the
harvest and increase which is to arise from it.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> We may further observe how Providence has taken care
to keep up this cheerfulness in the mind of man, by having formed
it after such a manner, as to make it capable of conceiving delight
from several objects which seem to have very little use in them; as
from the wildness of rocks and deserts, and the like grotesque
parts of nature. Those who are versed in philosophy may still carry
this consideration higher by observing, that, if matter had
appeared to us endowed only with those real qualities which it
actually possesses, it would have made but a very joyless and
uncomfortable figure; and why has Providence given it a power of
producing in us such imaginary qualities, as tastes and colours,
sounds and smells, heat and cold, but that man, while he is
conversant in the lowest stations of nature, might have his mind
cheered and delighted with agreeable sensations? In short, the
whole universe is a kind of theatre filled with objects that either
raise in us pleasure, amusement, or admiration.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> The reader's own thoughts may suggest to him the
vicissitude of day and night, the change of seasons, with all that
variety of scenes which diversify the face of nature, and fill the
mind with a perpetual succession of beautiful and pleasing
images.</p>
<p>I shall not here mention the several entertainments of art, with
the pleasures of friendship, books, conversation, and other
accidental diversions of life, because I would only take notice of
such incitements to a cheerful temper, as offer themselves to
persons of all ranks and Conditions, and which may sufficiently
show us, that Providence did not design this world should be filled
with murmurs and repinings, or that the heart of man should be
involved in gloom and melancholy.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> I the more inculcate this cheerfulness of temper, as
it is a virtue in which our countrymen are observed to be more
deficient than any other nation. Melancholy is a kind of
d&aelig;mon that haunts our island, and often conveys herself to us
in an easterly wind. A celebrated <i>French</i> novelist, in
opposition to those who begin their romances with a flowery season
of the year, enters on his story thus: <i>In the gloomy month
of</i> November, <i>when the people of</i> England <i>hang and
drown themselves, a disconsolate lover walked out into the
fields</i>, &amp;c.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> Every one ought to fence against the temper of his
climate or constitution, and frequently to indulge in himself those
considerations which may give him a serenity of mind, and enable
him to bear up cheerfully against those little evils and
misfortunes which are common to human nature, and which, by a right
improvement of them, will produce a satiety of joy, and an
uninterrupted happiness.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> At the same time that I would engage my readers to
consider the world in its most agreeable lights, I must own there
are many evils which naturally spring up amidst the entertainments
that are provided for us, but these, if rightly considered, should
be far from overcasting the mind with sorrow, or destroying that
cheerfulness of temper which I have been recommending.</p>
<p><b>14.</b> This interspersion of evil with good, and pain with
pleasure, in the works of nature, is very truly ascribed by Mr.
<i>Locke</i> in his Essay upon Human Understanding, to a moral
reason, in the following words:</p>
<p><i>Beyond all this, we may find another reason</i> why <i>God
hath scattered up and down</i> several degrees of pleasure and
pain, in all the things that environ and effect us, <i>and blended
them together in almost all that our thoughts and senses have to do
with; that we, finding imperfection, dissatisfaction, and want of
complete happiness in all the enjoyments which the creature can
afford us, might be fed to seek it in the enjoyment of him</i>,
with whom there is fulness of joy, and at whose right hand are
pleasures for evermore.</p>
<br>
<br>
<a name='Discretion' id="Discretion"></a>
<h2><i>Discretion</i>.</h2>
<br>
<p><b>1.</b> I have often thought if the minds of men were laid
open, we should see but little difference between that of the wise
man and that of the fool. There are infinite reveries, numberless
extravagancies, and a perpetual train of vanities, which pass
through both. The great difference is, that the first knows how to
pick and cull his thoughts for conversation, by suppressing some,
and communicating others; whereas the other lets them all
indifferently fly out in words. This sort of discretion, however,
has no place in private conversation between intimate friends. On
such occasions the wisest men very often talk like the weakest; for
indeed the talking with a friend is nothing else but thinking
aloud.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> <i>Tully</i> has therefore very justly exposed a
precept delivered by some ancient writers, that a man should live
with his enemy in such a manner, as might leave him room to become
his friend; and with his friend in such a manner, that if he became
his enemy, it should not be in his power to hurt him. The first
part of this rule, which regards our behaviour towards an enemy, is
indeed very reasonable, as well as prudential; but the latter part
of it, which regards our behaviour towards a friend, favours more
of cunning than of discretion, and would cut a man off from the
greatest pleasures of life, which are the freedoms of conversation
with a bosom friend. Besides, that when a friend is turned into an
enemy, and (as the son of <i>Sirach</i> calls him) a betrayer of
secrets, the world is just enough to accuse the perfidiousness of
the friend, rather than the indiscretion of the person who confided
in him.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> Discretion does not only shew itself in words, but In
all the circumstances of action; and is like an under-agent of
Providence, to guide and direct us in the ordinary concerns of
life.</p>
<p>There are many more shining qualities in the mind of man, but
there is none so useful as discretion; it is this indeed which
gives a value to all the rest, which sets them at work in their
proper times and places, and turns them to the advantage of the
person who is possessed of them. Without it, learning is pedantry,
and wit impertinence; virtue itself looks like weakness; the best
parts only qualify a man to be more sprightly in errors, and active
to his own prejudice.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> Nor does discretion only make a man the master of his
own parts, but of other men's. The discreet man finds out the
talents of those he converses with, and knows how to apply them to
proper uses. Accordingly, if we look into particular communities
and divisions of men, we may observe, that it is the discreet man,
not the witty, nor the learned, nor the brave, who guides the
conversation, and gives measures to the society. A man with great
talents, but void of discretion, is like <i>Polyphemus</i> in the
fable, strong and blind, endued with an irresistible force, which
for want of sight, is of no use to him.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> Though a man has all other perfections, and wants
discretion, he will be of no great consequence in the world; but if
he has this single talent in perfection and but a common share of
others, he may do what he pleases in his station of life.</p>
<p>At the same time that I think discretion the most useful talent
a man can be master of, I look upon cunning to be the
accomplishment of little, mean, ungenerous minds. Discretion points
out the noblest ends to us, and pursues the most proper and
laudable methods of attaining them; cunning has only private
selfish aims, and sticks at nothing which may make them
succeed.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> Discretion has large and extended views, and, like a
veil formed eye, commands a whole horizon: cunning is a kind of
short-sightedness, that discovers the minutest objects which are
near at hand, but is not able to discern things at a distance.
Discretion, the more it is discovered, gives a greater authority to
the person who possesses it; cunning, when it is once detected,
loses its force, and makes a man incapable of bringing about even
those events which he might have done, had he passed only for a
plain man. Discretion is the perfection of reason, and a guide to
us in all the duties of life: cunning is a kind of instinct, that
only looks out after our immediate interest and welfare.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> Discretion is only found in men of strong sense and
good understandings: cunning is often to be met with in brutes
themselves, and in persons who are but the fewest removes from
them. In short, cunning is only the mimic of discretion, and may
pass upon weak men, in the same manner as vivacity is often
mistaken for wit, and gravity for wisdom.</p>
<p>The cast of mind which is natural to a discreet man, makes him
look forward into futurity, and consider what will be his condition
millions of ages hence, as well as what it is at present.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> He knows, that the misery or happiness which are
reserved for him in another world, lose nothing of their reality by
being placed at so great a distance from him. The objects do not
appear little to him because they are remote. He considers that
those pleasures and pains which lie hid in eternity, approach
nearer to him every moment, and will be present with him in their
full weight and measure, as much as those pains and pleasures which
he feels at this very instant. For this reason he is careful to
secure to himself that which is the proper happiness of his nature,
and the ultimate design of his being.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> He carries his thoughts to the end of every action,
and considers the most distant as well as the most immediate
effects of it. He supercedes every little prospect of gain and
advantage which offers itself here, if he does not find it
consistent with his views of an hereafter. In a word, his hopes are
full of immortality, his schemes are large and glorious, and his
conduct suitable to one who knows his true interest, and how to
pursue it by proper methods.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> I have, in this essay upon discretion, considered it
both as an accomplishment and as a virtue, and have therefore
described it in its full extent; not only as it is conversant about
worldly affairs, but as it regards our whole existence; not only as
it is the guide of a mortal creature, but as it is in general the
director of a reasonable being. It is in this light that discretion
is represented by the wise man, who sometimes mentions it under the
name of discretion, and sometimes under that of wisdom.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> It is indeed (as described in the latter part of this
paper) the greatest wisdom, but at the same time in the power of
every one to attain. Its advantages are infinite, but its
acquisition easy; or, to speak of her in the words of the
apocryphal writer, "<i>Wisdom</i> is glorious, and never fadeth
away, yet she is easily seen of them that love her, and found of
such as seek her."</p>
<p><b>12.</b> "She preventeth them that desire her, in making
herself first known unto them. He that seeketh her early, shall
have no great travel: for he shall find her sitting at his doors.
To think, therefore, upon Her, is perfection of wisdom, and whoso
watcheth for her, shall quickly be without care. For she goeth
about seeking such as are worthy of her, sheweth herself favourably
unto them in the ways, and meeteth them in every thought."</p>

<a name='Pride' id="Pride"></a>
<h2><i>Pride</i>.</h2>
<br>
<p><b>1.</b> There is no passion which steals into the heart more
imperceptibly, and covers itself under more disguises, than pride.
For my own part, I think, if there is any passion or vice which I
am wholly a stranger to, it is this; though at the same time,
perhaps this very judgment which I form of myself, proceeds in some
measure from this corrupt principle.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> I have been always wonderfully delighted with that
sentence in holy writ, <i>Pride was not made for man</i>. There is
not, indeed, any single view of human nature under its present
condition, which is not sufficient to extinguish in us all the
secret seeds of pride; and, on the contrary, to sink the soul into
the lowest slate of humility, and what the school-men call
self-annihilation. Pride was not made for man, as he is,</p>
<div style='margin-left: 2em'>
<p><b>1.</b> A sinful,</p>
<p><b>2.</b> An ignorant,</p>
<p><b>3.</b> A miserable being.</p>
</div>
<p>There is nothing in his understanding, in his will, or in his
present condition, that can tempt any considerate creature to pride
or vanity.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> These three very reasons why he should not be proud,
are, notwithstanding, the reasons why he is so. Were not he a
sinful creature, he would not be subject to a passion which rises
from the depravity of his nature; were he not an ignorant creature,
he would see that he has nothing to be proud of; and were not the
whole species miserable, he would not have those wretched objects
before his eyes, which are the occasions of this passion, and which
make one man value himself more than another.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> A wise man will be contented that his glory be
deferred till such time as he shall be truly glorified; when his
understanding shall be cleared his will rectified, and his
happiness assured; or, in other words, when he shall be neither
sinful, nor ignorant, nor miserable.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> If there be any thing which makes human nature appear
<i>ridiculous</i> to beings of superior faculties, it must be
pride. They know so well the vanity of those imaginary perfections
that swell the heart of man, and of those little supernumerary
advantages, whether in birth, fortune, or title, which one man
enjoys above another, that it must certainly very much astonish, if
it does not very much divert them, when they see a mortal puffed
up, and valuing himself above his neighbours on any of these
accounts, at the same time that he is obnoxious to all the common
calamities of the species.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> To set this thought in its true light, we will fancy,
if you please, that yonder mole-hill is inhabited by reasonable
creatures, and that every pismire (his shape and way of life only
excepted) is endowed with human passions. How should we smile to
hear one give us an account of the pedigrees, distinctions, and
titles that reign among them!</p>
<p><b>7.</b> Observe how the whole swarm divide and make way for
the pismire that passes through them! You must understand he is an
emmet of quality, and has better blood in his veins than any
pismire in the mole-hill.&mdash;Don't you see how sensible he is of
it, how slow he marches forward, how the whole rabble of ants keep
their distance?</p>
<p><b>8.</b> Here you may observe one placed upon a little
eminence, and looking down upon a long row of labourers. He is the
richest insect on this side the hillock, he has a walk of half a
yard in length, and a quarter of an inch in breadth, he keeps a
hundred menial servants, and has at least fifteen barley-corns in
his granary. He is now chiding and beslaving the emmet that stands
before him, and who, for all that we can discover, is as good an
emmet as himself.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> But here comes an insect of figure! don't you take
notice of a little white straw that he carries in his mouth? That
straw, you must understand, he would not part with for the longest
tract about the mole-hill: did you but know what he has undergone
to purchase it! See how the ants of all qualities and conditions
swarm about him! Should this straw drop out of his mouth, you would
see all this numerous circle of attendants follow the next that
took it up, and leave the discarded insect, or run over his back to
come at his successor.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> If now you have a mind to see all the ladies of the
mole-hill, observe first the pismire that listens to the emmet on
her left hand, at the same time that she seems to turn away her
head from him. He tells this poor insect that she is a goddess,
that her eyes are brighter than the sun, that life and death are at
her disposal. She believes him, and gives herself a thousand little
airs upon it.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> Mark the vanity of the pismire on your left hand. She
can scarce crawl with age; but you must know she values herself
upon her birth; and if you mind, spurns at every one that comes
within her reach. The little nimble coquette that is running along
by the side of her, is a wit. She has broke many a pismire's heart.
Do but observe what a drove of lovers are running after her.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> We will here finish this imaginary scene; but first
of all, to draw the parallel closer, will suppose, if you please,
that death comes down upon the mole-hill in the shape of a
cock-sparrow, who picks up without distinction, the pismire of
quality and his flatterers, the pismire of substance and his day
labourers, the white straw officer and his sycophants, with all the
goddesses, wits, and beauties of the mole-hill.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> May we not imagine that beings of superior natures
and perfections regard all the instances of pride and vanity, among
our own species, in the same kind of view, when they take a survey
of those who inhabit the earth; or, in the language of an ingenious
<i>French</i> poet, of those pismires that people this heap of
dirt, which human vanity has divided into climates and regions.</p>

<a name='Drunkenness' id="Drunkenness"></a>
<h2><i>Drunkenness</i>.</h2>
<br>
<p><b>1.</b> No vices are so incurable as those which men are apt
to glory in. One would wonder how drunkenness should have the good
luck to be of this number. <i>Anarcharsis</i>, being invited to a
match of drinking at Corinth, demanded the prize very humourously,
because he was drunk before any of the rest of the company, for,
says he, when we run a race, he who arrives at the goal first, is
entitled to the reward:</p>
<p><b>2.</b> On the contrary, in this thirsty generation, the
honour falls upon him who carries off the greatest quantity of
liquor, and knocks down the rest of the company. I was the other
day with honest <i>Will Funnell</i>, the West Saxon, who was
reckoning up how much liquor had passed through him in the last
twenty years of his life, which, according to his computation,
amounted to twenty-three hogsheads of October, four ton of port,
half a kilderkin of small-beer, nineteen barrels of cyder, and
three glasses of champaigne; besides which he had assisted at four
hundred bowls of punch, not to mention sips, drams, and whets
without number.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> I question not but every reader's memory will suggest
to him several ambitious young men, who are as vain in this
particular as <i>Will Funnell</i>, and can boast of as glorious
exploits.</p>
<p>Our modern philosophers observe, that there is a general decay
of moisture in the globe of the earth. This they chiefly ascribe to
the growth of vegetables, which incorporate into their own
substance many fluid bodies that never return again to their former
nature:</p>
<p><b>4.</b> But with submission, they ought to throw into their
account, those innumerable rational beings which fetch their
nourishment chiefly out of liquids: especially when we consider
that men, compared with their fellow-creatures, drink much more
than comes to their share.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> But however highly this tribe of people may think of
themselves, a drunken man is a greater monster than any that is to
be found among all the creatures which God has made; as indeed
there is no character which appears more despicable and deformed,
in the eyes of all reasonable persons, than that of a drunkard.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> <i>Bonosus</i>, one of our own countrymen, who was
addicted to this vice, having set up for a share in the Roman
empire, and being defeated in a great battle, hanged himself. When
he was seen by the army in this melancholy situation,
notwithstanding he had behaved himself very bravely, the common
jest was, that the thing they saw hanging upon the tree before
them, was not a man, but a bottle.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> This vice has very fatal effects on the mind, the body
and fortune of the person who is devoted to it.</p>
<p>In regard to the mind, it first of all discovers every flaw in
it. The sober man, by the strength of reason, may keep under and
subdue every vice or folly to which he is most inclined; but wine
makes every latent seed sprout up in the soul, and shew itself: it
gives fury to the passions, and force to those objects which are
apt to produce them.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> When a young fellow complained to an old philosopher
that his wife was not handsome; Put less water into your wine, says
the philosopher, and you'll quickly make her so. Wine heightens
indifference into love, love into jealousy, and jealousy into
madness. It often turns the good natured man into an idiot, and the
choleric into an assassin. It gives bitterness to resentment, it
makes vanity insupportable, and displays every little spot of the
soul in its utmost deformity.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> Nor does this vice only betray the hidden faults of a
man, and shew them in most odious colours, but often occasions
faults to which he is not naturally subject. There is more of turn
than of truth in a saying of <i>Seneca</i>, that drunkenness does
not produce, but discover faults. Common experience teaches the
contrary.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> Wine throws a man out of himself, and infuses
qualities into the mind, which she is a stranger to in her sober
moments. The person you converse with, after the third bottle, is
not the same man who at first sat down at the table with you. Upon
this maxim is founded one of the prettiest sayings I ever met with,
which is inscribed to <i>Publius Syrus, He who jests unto a man
that is drunk, injures the absent</i>.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> Thus does drunkenness act in direct contradiction to
reason, whose business it is to clear the mind of every vice which
is crept into it, and to guard it against all the approaches of any
that endeavour to make its entrance. But besides these ill effects
which this vice produces in the person who is actually under its
dominion, it has also a bad influence on the mind, even in its
sober moments, as it insensibly weakens the understanding, impairs
the memory, and makes those faults habitual which are produced by
frequent excesses: it wastes the estate, banishes reputation,
consumes the body, and renders a man of the brightest parts the
common jest of an insignificant clown.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> A method of spending one's time agreeably is a thing
so little studied, that the common amusement of our young gentlemen
(especially of such as are at a great distance from those of the
first breeding) is drinking. This way of entertainment has custom
on its side; but as much as it has prevailed, I believe there have
been very few companies that have been guilty of excess this way,
where there have not happened more accidents which make against,
than for the continuance of it.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> It is very common that events arise from a debauch
which are fatal, and always such as are disagreeable. With all a
man's reason and good sense about him, his tongue is apt to utter
things out of a mere gaiety of heart, which may displease his best
friends. Who then would trust himself to the power of wine, without
saying more against it, than, that it raises the imagination and
depresses judgment?</p>
<p><b>14.</b> Were there only this single consideration, that we
are less masters of ourselves when we drink in the least proportion
above the exigencies of thirst: I say, were this all that could be
objected, it were sufficient to make us abhor this vice. But we may
go on to say, that as he who drinks but a little is not master of
himself, so he who drinks much is a slave to himself.</p>
<p><b>15.</b> As for my part, I ever esteemed a drunkard of all
vicious persons the most vicious: for if our actions are to be
weighed and considered according to the intention of them, what can
we think of him who puts himself into a circumstance wherein he can
have no intention at all, but incapacitates himself for the duties
and offices of life, by a suspension of all his faculties.</p>
<p><b>16.</b> If a man considers that he cannot, under the
oppression of drink, be a friend, a gentleman, a master, or a
subject; that he has so long banished himself from all that is
dear, and given up all that is sacred to him, he would even then
think of a debauch with horror; but when he looks still further,
and acknowledges that he is not only expelled out of all the
relations of life, but also liable to offend against them all, what
words can express the terror and detestation he would have of such
a condition? And yet he owns all this of himself who says he was
drunk last night.</p>
<p><b>17.</b> As I have all along persisted in it, that all the
vicious in general are in a state of death, so I think I may add to
the non-existence of drunkards that they died by their own hands.
He is certainly as guilty of suicide who perishes by a slow, as he
that is dispatched by an immediate poison.</p>
<p><b>18.</b> In my last lucubration I proposed the general use of
water-gruel, and hinted that it might not be amiss at this very
season: but as there are some, whose cases, in regard to their
families, will not admit of delay, I have used my interest in
several wards of the city, that the wholesome restorative
above-mentioned may be given in tavern kitchens to all the mornings
draught-men within the walls when they call for wine before
noon.</p>
<p><b>19.</b> For a further restraint and mark upon such persons, I
have given orders, that in all the officers where policies are
drawn upon lives, it shall be added to the article which prohibits
that the nominee should cross the sea, the words, <i>Provided also,
That the above-mentioned</i> A.B. <i>shall not drink before dinner
during the term mentioned in this indenture</i>.</p>
<p><b>20.</b> I am not without hopes that by this method I shall
bring some unsizeable friends of mine into shape and breadth, as
well as others who are languid and consumptive into health and
vigour. Most of the self-murderers whom I yet hinted at, are such
as preserve a certain regularity in taking their poison, and make
it mix pretty well with their food:</p>
<p><b>21.</b> But the most conspicuous of those who destroy
themselves, are such as in their youth fall into this sort of
debauchery, and contract a certain uneasiness of spirit, which is
not to be diverted but by tippling as often as they can fall into
company in the day, and conclude with down-right drunkenness at
night. These gentlemen never know the satisfaction of youth, but
skip the years of manhood, and are decrepid soon after they are of
age.</p>
<p><b>22.</b> I was godfather to one of these old fellows. He is
now three and thirty, which is the grand climacteric of a young
drunkard. I went to visit the crazy wretch this morning, with no
other purpose but to rally him, under the pain and uneasiness of
being sober.</p>
<p>But as our faults are double when they effect others besides
ourselves, so this vice is still more odious in a married than a
single man.</p>
<p><b>23.</b> He that is the husband of a woman of honour, and
comes home overloaded with wine, is still more contemptible, in
proportion to the regard we have to the unhappy consort of his
bestiality. The imagination cannot shape to itself any thing more
monstrous and unnatural, than the familiarities between drunkenness
and chastity. The wretched <i>Astr&aelig;a</i>, who is the
perfection of beauty and innocence, has long been thus condemned
for life. The romantic tales of virgins devoted to the jaws of
monsters, have nothing in them so terrible, as the gift of
<i>Astr&aelig;a</i> to that bacchanal.</p>
<p><b>24.</b> The reflection of such a match as spotless innocence
with abandoned lewdness, is what puts this vice in the worst figure
it can bear with regard to others; but when it is looked upon with
respect only to the drunkard himself, it has deformities enough to
make it disagreeable, which may be summed up in a word, by
allowing, that he who resigns his reason, is actually guilty of all
that he is liable to from the want of reason.</p>

slumbers are haunted with kings, queens, and knaves. The day lies
heavy upon her till the play-season returns, when for half a dozen
hours together, all her faculties are employed in shuffling,
cutting, dealing and sorting out a pack of cards; and no ideas to
be discovered in a soul which calls itself rational, excepting
little square figures of painted and spotted paper.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> Was the understanding, that divine part in our
composition, given for such an use? Is it thus that we improve the
greatest talent human nature is endowed with? What would a superior
being think, were he shewn this intellectual faculty in a female
gamester, and at the same time told, that it was by this she was
distinguished from brutes, and allied to angels?</p>
<p><b>6.</b> When our women thus fill their imaginations with pips
and counters, I cannot wonder at the story I have lately heard of a
new-born child that was marked with the five of clubs.</p>
<p>Their passions suffer no less by this practice than their
understandings and imaginations. What hope and fear, joy and anger,
sorrow and discontent, break out all at once in a fair assembly,
upon so noble an occasion as that of turning up a card?</p>
<p><b>7.</b> Who can consider, without a secret indignation, that
all those affections of the mind which should be consecrated to
their children, husbands and parents, are thus vilely prostituted
and thrown away upon a hand at loo? For my own part, I cannot but
be grieved, when I see a fine woman fretting and bleeding inwardly
from such trivial motives: when I behold the face of an angel,
agitated and discomposed by the heart of a fury.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> Our minds are of such a make, that they naturally give
themselves up to every diversion which they are much accustomed to,
and we always find, that play, when followed with assiduity,
engrosses the whole woman. She quickly grows uneasy in her own
family, takes but little pleasure in all the domestic innocent
endearments of life, and grows more fond of <i>Pam</i> than of her
husband.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> My friend <i>Theophrastus</i>, the best of husbands
and of fathers, has often complained to me, with tears in his eyes,
of the late hours he is forced to keep if he would enjoy his wife's
conversation. When she returns to me with joy in her face, it does
not arise, says he, from the sight of her husband but from the good
luck she has had at cards.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> On the contrary, says he, if she has been a loser, I
am doubly a sufferer by it. She comes home out of humor, is angry
with every body, displeased with all I can do or say, and in
reality for no other reason but because she has been throwing away
my estate. What charming bed fellows and companions for life are
men likely to meet with, that chuse their wives out of such women
of vogue and fashion? What a race of worthies, what patriots, what
heroes must we expect from mothers of this make?</p>
<p><b>11.</b> I come in the next place to consider the ill
consequences which gaming has on the bodies of our female
adventurers. It is so ordered, that almost every thing which
corrupts the soul decays the body. The beauties of the face and
mind are generally destroyed by the same means. This consideration
should have a particular weight with the female world, who are
designed to please the eye and attract the regards of the other
half of the species.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> Now there is nothing that wears out a fine face like
the vigils of the card table, and those cutting passions which
naturally attend them. Hollow eyes, haggard looks, and pale
complexions, are the natural indications of a female gamester. Her
morning sleeps are not able to repair her midnight watchings.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> I have known a woman carried off half dead from
bassette, and have many a time grieved, to see a person of quality
gliding by me in her chair at two o'clock in the morning, and
looking like a spectre amidst a glare of flambeaux: in short, I
never knew a thorough-paced female gamester hold her beauty two
winters together.</p>
<p><b>14.</b> But there is still another case in which the body is
more endangered than in the former. All play-debts must be paid in
specie, or by an equivalent. The man that plays beyond his income
pawns his estate; the woman must find out something else to
mortgage when her pin-money is gone. The husband has his lauds to
dispose of, the wife her person. Now when the female body is once
<i>dipped</i>, if the creditor be very importunate, I leave my
reader to consider the consequences.</p>
<p><b>15.</b> It is needless here to mention the ill consequences
attending this passion among the men, who are often bubbled out of
their money and estates by sharpers, and to make up their loss,
have recourse to means productive of dire events, instances of
which frequently occur; for strictly speaking, those who set their
minds upon gaming, can hardly be honest; a man's reflections, after
losing, render him desperate, so as to commit violence either upon
himself or some other person, and therefore gaming should be
discouraged in all well regulated communities.</p>

<a name='Whisperers' id="Whisperers"></a>
<h2><i>Whisperers</i>.</h2>
<p>SIR,</p>
<p><b>1.</b> As the ladies are naturally become the immediate
objects of your care, will you permit a complaint to be inserted in
your paper, which is founded upon matter of fact? They will pardon
me, if by laying before you a particular instance I was lately
witness to of their improper behaviour, I endeavour to expose a
reigning evil, which subjects them to many shameful
imputations.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> I received last week a dinner card from a friend, with
an intimation that I should meet some very agreeable ladies. At my
arrival, I found that the company consisted chiefly of females, who
indeed did me the honour to rise, but quite disconcerted me in
paying my respects, by their whispering each other, and appearing
to stifle a laugh. When I was seated, the ladies grouped themselves
up in a corner, and entered into a private cabal, seemingly to
discourse upon points of great secrecy and importance, but of equal
merriment and diversion.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> The same conduct of keeping close to their ranks was
observed at table, where the ladies seated themselves together.
Their conversation was here also confined wholly to themselves, and
seemed like the mysteries of the <i>Bonna Deo</i>, in which men
were forbidden to have any share. It was a continued laugh and a
whisper from the beginning to the end of dinner. A whole sentence
was scarce ever spoken aloud.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> Single words, indeed, now and then broke forth; such
as <i>odious</i>, <i>horrid</i>, <i>detestable</i>,
<i>shocking</i>, HUMBUG. This last new-coined expression, which is
only to be found in the nonsensical vocabulary, sounds absurd and
disagreeable, whenever it is pronounced; but from the mouth of a
lady it is, "shocking, detestable, horrible and odious."</p>
<p><b>5.</b> My friend seemed to be in an uneasy situation at his
own table; but I was far more miserable. I was mute, and seldom
dared to lift up my eyes from my plate, or turn my head to call for
small beer, lest by some aukward posture I might draw upon me a
whisper or a laugh. <i>Sancho</i>, when he was forbid to eat of a
delicious banquet set before him, could scarce appear more
melancholy.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> The rueful length of my face might possibly increase
the mirth of my tormentors: at least their joy seemed to rise in
exact proportion with my misery. At length, however, the time of my
delivery approached. Dinner ended, the ladies made their exit in
pairs, and went off hand in hand whispering like the two kings of
<i>Brentford</i>.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> Modest men, Mr. <i>Town</i>, are deeply wounded when
they imagine themselves the subjects of ridicule or contempt; and
the pain is the greater, when it is given by those whom they
admire, and from whom they are ambitious of receiving any marks of
countenance and favour. Yet we must allow, that affronts are
pardonable from ladies, as they are often prognostics of future
kindness.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> If a lady strikes our cheek, we can very willingly
follow the precept of the gospel, and turn the other cheek to be
smitten: even a blow from a fair hand conveys pleasure. But this
battery of whispers is against all legal rights of war; poisoned
arrows and stabs in the dark, are not more repugnant to the general
laws of humanity.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> Modern writers of comedy often introduce a pert
titling into their pieces, who is very severe upon the rest of the
company; but all his waggery is spoken <i>aside</i>.&mdash;These
giglers and whisperers seem to be acting the same part in company
that this arch rogue does in the play. Every word or motion
produces a train of whispers; the dropping of a snuff-box, or
spilling the tea, is sure to be accompanied with a titter: and,
upon the entrance of any one with something particular in his
person, or manner, I have seen a whole room in a buz like a bee
hive.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> This practice of whispering, if it is any where
allowable, may perhaps be indulged the fair sex at church, where
the conversation can only be carried on by the secret symbols of a
curtsy, an ogle, or a nod. A whisper in this place is very often of
great use, as it serves to convey the most secret intelligence,
which a lady would be ready to burst with, if she could not find
vent for it by this kind of auricular confession. A piece of
scandal transpires in this manner from one pew to another, then
presently whizes along the channel, from whence it crawls up to the
galleries, till at last the whole church hums with it.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> It were also to be wished, that the ladies would be
pleased to confine themselves to whispering in their
<i>tete-a-tete</i> conferences at an opera or the play-house; which
would be a proper deference to the rest of the audience. In
<i>France</i>, we are told, it is common for the <i>parterre</i> to
join with the performers in any favorite air: but we seem to have
carried this custom still further, as the company in our boxes,
without concerning themselves in the least with the play, are even
louder than the players.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> The wit and humour of a <i>Vanbrugh</i>, or a
<i>Congreve,</i> is frequently interrupted by a brilliant dialogue
between two persons of fashion; and a love scene in the side box
has often been more attended to, than that on the stage. As to
their loud bursts of laughter at the theatre, they may very well be
excused, when they are excited by any lively strokes in a comedy:
but I have seen our ladies titter at the most distressful scenes in
<i>Romeo</i> and <i>Juliet</i>, grin over the anguish of a
<i>Monimia</i>, or <i>Belvidera</i>, and fairly laugh king
<i>Lear</i> off the stage.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> Thus the whole behaviour of these ladies is in direct
contradiction to good manners. They laugh when they should cry, are
loud when they should be silent, and are silent when their
conversation is desirable. If a man in a select company was thus to
laugh or whisper me out of countenance, I should be apt to construe
it as an affront, and demand an explanation.</p>
<p><b>14.</b> As to the ladies I would desire them to reflect how
much they would suffer, if their own weapons were turned against
them, and the gentlemen should attack them with the same arts of
laughing and whispering. But, however free they may be from our
resentment, they are still open to ill-natured suspicions. They do
not consider, what strange constructions may be put on these laughs
and whispers.</p>
<p><b>15.</b> It were indeed, of little consequence, if we only
imagined, that they were taking the reputation of their
acquaintance to pieces, or abusing the company round; but when they
indulge themselves in this behaviour, some perhaps may be led to
conclude, that they are discoursing upon topics, which they are
ashamed to speak of in a less private manner.</p>
<p><b>16.</b> If the misconduct which I have described, had been
only to be found, Mr. <i>Town</i>, at my friend's table, I should
not have troubled you with this letter: but the same kind of ill
breeding prevails too often, and in too many places. The giglers
and the whisperers are innumerable; they beset us wherever we go;
and it is observable, that after a short murmur of whispers, out
comes the burst of laughter: like a gunpowder serpent, which, after
hissing about for some time, goes off in a bounce.</p>
<p><b>17.</b> Some excuse may perhaps be framed for this ill-timed
merriment, in the fair sex. <i>Venus</i>, the goddess of beauty, is
frequently called <i>laughter-loving dame</i>; and by laughing, our
modern ladies may possibly imagine, that they render themselves
like <i>Venus</i>. I have indeed remarked, that the ladies commonly
adjust their laugh to their persons, and are merry in proportion as
it sets off their particular charms.</p>
<p><b>18.</b> One lady is never further moved than to a smile or a
simper, because nothing else shews her dimples to so much
advantage; another who has a fine set of teeth, runs into a broad
grin; while a third, who is admired for a well turned neck and
graceful chest, calls up all her beauties to view by breaking into
violent and repeated peals of laughter.</p>
<p><b>19.</b> I would not be understood to impose gravity or too
great a reserve on the fair sex. Let them laugh at a feather; but
let them declare openly, that it is a feather which occasions their
mirth. I must confess, that laughter becomes the young, the gay,
and the handsome: but a whisper is unbecoming at all ages, and in
both sexes: nor ought it ever to be practised, except in the round
gallery of St. <i>Paul's</i>, or in the famous whispering place in
<i>Gloucester</i> cathedral, where two whisperers hear each other
at the distance of five-and-twenty yards.</p>
<div style='text-align: right; margin-right: 10%;'><i>I am,
Sir,<br>
<br>
Your humble Servant.</i></div>
<br>
<br>
<a name='Beauty' id="Beauty"></a>
<h2><i>Beauty</i>.</h2>
<p><b>1.</b> Though the danger of disappointment is always in
proportion to the height of expectation, yet I this day claim the
attention of the ladies, and profess to teach an art by which all
may obtain what has hitherto been deemed the prerogative of a few:
an art by which their predominant passion may be gratified, and
their conquest not only extended, but secured; "The art of being
PRETTY."</p>
<p><b>2.</b> But though my subject may interest the ladies, it may,
perhaps, offend those profound moralists who have long since
determined, that beauty ought rather to be despised than desired;
that, like strength, it is a mere natural excellence, the effect
that causes wholly out of our power, and not intended either as the
pledge of happiness or the distinction of merit.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> To these gentlemen I shall remark, that beauty is
among those qualities which no effort of human wit could ever bring
into contempt: it is therefore to be wished at least, that beauty
was in some degree dependent upon sentiment and manners, that so
high a privilege might not be possessed by the unworthy, and that
human reason might no longer suffer the mortification of those who
are compelled to adore an idol, which differs from a stone or log
only by the skill of the artificer: and if they cannot themselves
behold beauty with indifference, they must, surely, approve an
attempt to shew that it merits their regard.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> I shall, however, principally consider that species of
beauty which is expressed in the countenance; for this alone is
peculiar to human beings, and is not less complicated than their
nature. In the countenance there are but two requisites to perfect
beauty, which are wholly produced by external causes, colour and
proportion: and it will appear, that even in common estimation
these are not the chief; but that though there may be beauty
without them, yet there cannot be beauty without something
more.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> The finest features, ranged in the most exact
symmetry, and heightened by the most blooming complexion, must be
animated before they can strike; and when they are animated, will
generally excite the same passions which they express. If they are
fixed in the dead calm of insensibility, they will be examined
without emotion; and if they do not express kindness, they will be
beheld without love.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> Looks of contempt, disdain, or malevolence, will be
reflected, as from a mirror, by every countenance on which they are
turned; and if a wanton aspect excites desire; it is but like that
of a savage for his prey, which cannot be gratified without the
destruction of its object.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> Among particular graces, the dimple has always been
allowed the pre-eminence, and the reason is evident; dimples are
produced by a smile, and a smile is an expression of complacency;
so the contraction of the brows into a frown, as it is an
indication of a contrary temper, has always been deemed a capital
defect.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> The lover is generally at a loss to define the beauty,
by which his passion was suddenly and irresistibly determined to a
particular object; but this could never happen, if it depended upon
any known rule of proportion, upon the shape and disposition of the
features, or the colour of the skin: he tells you that it is
something which he cannot fully express, something not fixed in any
part, but diffused over the whole; he calls it a sweetness, a
softness, a placid sensibility, or gives it some other appellation
which connects beauty with sentiment, and expresses a charm which
is not peculiar to any set of features, but is perhaps possible to
all.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> This beauty, however, does not always consist in
smiles, but varies as expressions of meekness and kindness vary
with their objects: it is extremely forcible in the silent
complaint of patient sufferance, the tender solicitude of
friendship, and the glow of filial obedience; and in tears, whether
of joy, of pity, or of grief, it is almost irresistible.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> This is the charm which captivates without the aid of
nature, and without which her utmost bounty is ineffectual. But it
cannot be assumed as a mask to conceal insensibility or
malevolence; it must be the genuine effect of corresponding
sentiments, or it will impress upon the countenance a new and more
disgusting deformity, affectation: it will produce the grin, the
simper, the stare, the languish, the pout, and innumerable other
grimaces, that render folly ridiculous, and change pity to
contempt.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> By some, indeed, this species of hypocrisy has been
practised with such skill as to deceive superficial observers,
though it can deceive even those but for a moment.&mdash;Looks
which do not correspond with the heart, cannot be assumed without
labour, nor continued without pain; the motive to relinquish them
must, therefore, soon preponderate, and the aspect and apparel of
the visit will be laid by together; the smiles and languishments of
art will vanish, and the fierceness of rage, or the gloom of
discontent, will either obscure or destroy all the elegance of
symmetry and complexion.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> The artificial aspect is, indeed, as wretched a
substitute for the expression of sentiment; as the smear of paint
for the blushes of health: it is not only equally transient, and
equally liable to dejection; but as paint leaves the countenance
yet more withered and ghastly, the passions burst out with move
violence after restraint, the features become more distorted and
excite more determined aversion.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> Beauty, therefore, depends principally upon the mind,
and, consequently, may be influenced by education. It has been
remarked, that the predominant passion may generally be discovered
in the countenance; because the muscles by which it is expressed,
being almost perpetually contracted, lose their tone, and never
totally relax; so that the expression remains when the passion is
suspended; thus an angry, a disdainful, a subtle and a suspicious
temper, is displayed in characters that are almost universally
understood.</p>
<p><b>14.</b> It is equally true of the pleasing and the softer
passions, that they leave their signatures upon the countenance
when they cease to act: the prevalence of these passions,
therefore, produces a mechanical effect upon the aspect, and gives
a turn and cast to the features which makes a more favorable and
forcible impression upon the mind of others, than any charm
produced by mere external causes.</p>
<p><b>15.</b> Neither does the beauty which depends upon temper and
sentiment, equally endanger the possessor: "It is," to use an
eastern metaphor, "like the towers of a city, not only an ornament,
but a defence;" if it excites desire, it at once controls and
refines it; it represses with awe, it softens with delicacy, and it
wins to imitation. The love of reason and virtue is mingled with
the love of beauty; because this beauty is little more than the
emanation of intellectual excellence, which is not an object of
corporeal appetite.</p>
<p><b>16.</b> As it excites a purer passion, it also more forcibly
engages to fidelity: every man finds himself more powerfully
restrained from giving pain to goodness than to beauty; and every
look of a countenance in which they are blended, in which beauty is
the expression of goodness, is a silent reproach of the first
irregular wish: and the purpose immediately appears to be
disingenious and cruel, by which the tender hope of ineffable
affection would be disappointed, the placid confidence of
unsuspected simplicity abased, and the peace even of virtue
endangered by the most sordid infidelity, and the breach of the
strongest obligations.</p>
<p><b>17.</b> But the hope of the hypocrite must perish. When the
fictitious beauty has laid by her smiles, when the lustre of her
eyes and the bloom of her cheeks have lost their influence with
their novelty; what remains but a tyrant divested of power, who
will never be seen without a mixture of indignation and disdain?
The only desire which this object could gratify, will be
transferred to another, not only without reluctance, but with
triumph.</p>
<p><b>18.</b> As resentment will succeed to disappointment, a
desire to mortify will succeed to a desire to please; and the
husband may be urged to solicit a mistress, merely by a remembrance
of the beauty of his wife, which lasted only till she was
known.</p>
<p>Let it therefore be remembered, that none can be disciples of
the Graces, but in the school of Virtue; and that those who wish to
be lovely, must learn early to be good.</p>
<p><b>19.</b> A FRIEND of mine has two daughters, whom I will call
<i>L&aelig;titia</i> and <i>Daphne</i>. The former is one of the
greatest beauties of the age in which she lives; the latter no way
remarkable for any charms in her person. Upon this one circumstance
of their outward form, the good and ill of their life seem to turn.
<i>L&aelig;titia</i> has not from her very childhood heard any
thing else but commendations of her features and complexion, by
which means she is no other than nature made her, a very beautiful
outside.</p>
<p><b>20.</b> The consciousness of her charms has rendered her
insupportably vain and insolent towards all who have to do with
her. <i>Daphne</i>, who was almost twenty before one civil thing
had ever been said to her, found herself obliged to acquire some
accomplishments to make up for the want of those attractions which
she saw in her sister.</p>
<p><b>21.</b> Poor <i>Daphne</i> was seldom submitted to in a
debate wherein she was concerned; her discourse had nothing to
recommend it but the good sense of it, and she was always under a
necessity to have very well considered what she was to say before
she uttered it; while <i>L&aelig;titia</i> was listened to with
partiality, and approbation sat in the countenances of those she
conversed with, before she communicated what she had to say.</p>
<p><b>22.</b> These causes have produced suitable effects, and
<i>L&aelig;titia</i> is as insipid a companion as <i>Daphne</i> is
an agreeable one. <i>L&aelig;titia</i>, confident of favour, has
studied no arts to please: <i>Daphne</i>, despairing of any
inclination towards her person, has depended only on her merit.
<i>L&aelig;titia</i> has always something in her air that is
sullen, grave and disconsolate.</p>
<p><b>23.</b> <i>Daphne</i> has a countenance that appears
cheerful, open and unconcerned. A young gentleman saw
<i>L&aelig;titia</i> this winter at play, and became her captive.
His fortune was such, that he wanted very little introduction to
speak his sentiments to her father. The lover was admitted with the
utmost freedom into the family, where a constrained behaviour,
severe looks, and distant civilities were the highest favours he
could obtain from <i>L&aelig;titia</i>; while <i>Daphne</i> used
him with the good humour, familiarity, and innocence of a
sister.</p>
<p><b>24.</b> Insomuch that he would often say to her, <i>Dear
Daphne, wert thou but as handsome as L&aelig;titia!</i>&mdash;She
received such language with that ingenious and pleasing mirth,
which is natural to a woman without design. He still sighed in vain
for <i>L&aelig;titia</i> but found certain relief in the agreeable
conversation of <i>Daphne</i>. At length, heartily tired with the
haughty impertinence of <i>L&aelig;titia</i>, and charmed with
repeated instances of good humour he had observed in <i>Daphne</i>,
he one day told the latter, that he had something to say to her he
hoped she would be pleased with.</p>
<p><b>25.</b> &mdash;&mdash;<i>Faith Daphne</i>, continued he, <i>I
am in love with thee, and despise thy sister sincerely</i>. The
manner of his declaring himself gave his mistress occasion for a
very hearty laughter.&mdash;<i>Nay</i>, says he, <i>I knew you
would laugh at me, but I'll ask your father</i>. He did so; the
father received his intelligence with no less joy than surprize,
and was very glad he had now no care left but for his beauty, which
he thought he would carry to market at his leisure.</p>
<p><b>26.</b> I do not know any thing that has pleased me so much a
great while, as this conquest of my friend <i>Daphne's</i>. All her
acquaintance congratulate her upon her chance medley, and laugh at
that premeditating murderer, her sister. As it is an argument of a
light mind, to think the worse of ourselves for the imperfections
of our persons, it is equally below us to value ourselves upon the
advantages of them.</p>
<p><b>27.</b> The female world seems to be almost incorrigibly gone
astray in this particular; for which reason, I shall recommend the
following extract out of a friend's letter to the profess'd
beauties, who are a people almost as insufferable as the profess'd
wits.</p>
<p>'Monsier St. <i>Evrement</i> has concluded one of his essays
with affirming, that the last sighs of a handsome woman are not so
much for the loss of her life, as her beauty.</p>
<p><b>28.</b> 'Perhaps this raillery is pursued too far, yet it is
turned upon a very obvious remark, that woman's strongest passion
is for her own beauty, and that she values it as her favourite
distinction. From hence it is that all hearts, which intend to
improve or preserve it, meet with so general a reception among the
sex.</p>
<p><b>29.</b> To say nothing Of many false helps, and contraband
wares of beauty, which are daily vended in this great mart, there
is not a maiden gentlewoman, of a good family, in any county of
<i>South Britain</i>, who has not heard of the virtues of may-dew,
or is unfurnished with some receipt or other in favour of her
complexion; and I have known a physician of learning and sense,
after eight years study in the university and a course of travels
into most countries of <i>Europe</i>, owe the first raising of his
fortune to a cosmetic wash.</p>
<p><b>30.</b> 'This has given me occasion to consider how so
universal a disposition in womankind, which springs from a laudable
motive, the desire of pleasing, and proceeds upon an opinion, not
altogether groundless, that nature may be helped by art, may be
turned to their advantage. And, methinks, it would be an acceptable
service to take them out of the hands of quacks and pretenders, and
to prevent their imposing upon themselves, by discovering to them
the true secret and art of improving beauty.</p>
<p><b>31.</b> 'In order to do this, before I touch upon it
directly, it will be necessary to lay down a few preliminary
maxims, <i>viz.</i></p>
<p>That no woman can be handsome by the force of features alone,
any more she can be witty only by the help of speech.</p>
<p>That pride destroys all symmetry and grace, and affectation is a
more terrible enemy to fine faces than the small-pox.</p>
<p>That no woman is capable of being beautiful, who is not
incapable of being false.</p>
<p>And, that what would be odious in a friend, is deformity in a
mistress.</p>
<p><b>32.</b> 'From these few principles thus laid down, it will be
easy to prove that the true art of assisting beauty consists in
embellishing the whole person by the proper ornaments of virtuous
and commendable qualities. By this help alone it is, that those who
are the favourite work of nature, or, as Mr. <i>Dryden</i>
expresses it, the porcelain clay of human kind, become animated,
and are in a capacity of exerting their charms: and those who seem
to have been neglected by her, like models wrought in haste, are

<h2><i>Honour</i>.</h2>
<br>
<p><b>1.</b> Every principle that is a motive to good actions,
ought to be encouraged, since men are of so different a make, that
the same principle does not work equally upon all minds. What some
men are prompted to by conscience, duty, or religion, which are
only different names for the same thing, others are prompted to by
honour.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> The sense of honour is of so fine and delicate a
nature, that it is only to be met with in minds which are naturally
noble, or in such as have been cultivated by great examples, or a
refined education. This paper, therefore, is chiefly designed for
those who by means of any of these advantages, are, or ought to be,
actuated by this glorious principle.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> 'But as nothing is more pernicious than a principle or
action, when it is misunderstood, I shall consider honour with
respect to three sorts of men. First of all, with regard to those
who have a right notion of it. Secondly, with regard to those who
have a mistaken notion of it. And thirdly, with regard to those who
treat it as chimerical, and turn it into ridicule.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> 'In the first place, true honour, though it be a
different principle from religion, is that which produces the same
effects. The lines of action, though drawn from different parts,
terminate in the same point. Religion embraces virtue as it is
enjoined by the laws of God: Honour, as it is graceful and
ornamental to human nature.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> 'The religious man <i>fears</i>, the man of honor
<i>scorns</i> to do an ill action. The former considers vice as
something that is beneath him, the other as something that is
offensive to the Divine Being. The one as what is
<i>unbecoming</i>, the other as what <i>forbidden</i>. Thus
<i>Seneca</i> speaks in the natural and genuine language of a man
of honor, when he declares that were there no God to see or punish
vice, he would not commit it, because it is of so mean, so base,
and so vile a nature.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> 'I shall conclude this head with the description of
honor in the part of young <i>Juba</i>.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'><span>Honour's a sacred tie, the law of
kings,<br></span> <span>The noble mind's distinguishing
perfection,<br></span> <span>That aids and strengthens virtue where
it meets her,<br></span> <span>And imitates her actions where she
is not.<br></span> <span>It ought not to be sported with.&mdash;
CATO.<br></span></div>
</div>
<p><b>7.</b> 'In the second place we are to consider those who have
mistaken notions of honor, and these are such as establish any
thing to themselves for a point of honor which is contrary either
to the laws of God, or of their country; who think it is more
honourable to revenge than to forgive an injury; who make no
scruple of telling a lie, but would put any man to death that
accuses them of it: who are more careful to guard their reputation
by their courage than by their virtue.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> 'True fortitude is indeed so becoming in human nature,
that he who wants it scarce deserves the name of a man; but we find
several who so much abuse this notion that they place the whole
idea of honor in a kind of brutal courage; by which means we have
had many among us who have called themselves men of honour, that
would have been a disgrace to a gibbet.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> In a word, the man who sacrifices any duty of a
reasonable creature to a prevailing mode of fashion, who looks upon
any thing as honourable that is displeasing to his Maker, or
destructive to society, who thinks himself obliged by this
principle to the practice of some virtues and not of others, is by
no means to be reckoned among true men of honor.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> <i>Timogenes</i> was a lively instance of one
actuated by false honor. <i>Timogenes</i> would smile at a man's
jest who ridiculed his Maker, and at the same time run a man thro'
the body that spoke ill of his friend. <i>Timogenes</i> would have
scorned to have betrayed a secret, that was intrusted with him,
though the fate of his country depended upon the discovery of
it.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> <i>Timogenes</i> took away the life of a young fellow
in a duel, for having spoken ill of <i>Belinda</i>, a lady whom he
himself had seduced in his youth, and betrayed into want and
ignominy. To close his character, <i>Timogenes</i>, after having
ruined several poor tradesmen's families, who had trusted him, sold
his estate to satisfy his creditors; but, like a man of honor,
disposed of all the money he could make of it, in paying off his
play-debts, or, to speak in his own language, his debts of
honor.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> In the third place, we are to consider those persons,
who treat this principle as chimerical, and turn it into ridicule.
Men who are professedly of no honour, are of a more profligate and
abandoned nature, than even those who are actuated by false notions
of it, as there is more hope of a heretic than of an atheist. These
sons of infamy consider honor with old <i>Syphax</i>, in the play
before mentioned, as a fine imaginary notion, that leads astray
young unexperienced men, and draws them into real mischief, while
they are engaged in the pursuits of a shadow.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> These are generally persons, who, in
<i>Shakspeare's</i> phrase, are <i>worn and hackney'd in the ways
of men</i>; whose imaginations are grown callous, and have lost all
those delicate sentiments which are natural to minds that are
innocent and undepraved. Such old battered miscreants ridicule
every thing as romantic, that comes in competition with their
present interest, and treat those persons as visionaries who dare
stand up in a corrupt age, for what has not its immediate reward
joined to it.</p>
<p><b>14.</b> The talents, interest, or experience of such men,
make them very often useful in all parties, and at all times. But
whatever wealth and dignities they may arrive at, they ought to
consider, that every one stands as a blot in the annals of his
country, who arrives at the temple of <i>honor</i> by any other way
than through that of <i>virtue</i>.</p>

<a name='Human_Nature' id="Human_Nature"></a>
<h2><i>Human Nature</i>.</h2>
<br>
<p>Mr. SPECTATOR,</p>
<p><b>1.</b> 'I have always been a very great lover of your
speculations, as well in regard to the subject, as to your manner
of treating it. Human nature I always thought the most useful
object of human reason, and to make the consideration of it
pleasant and entertaining, I always thought the best employment of
human wit: other parts of philosophy may make us wiser, but this
not only answers that end, but makes us better too.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> 'Hence it was that the oracle pronounced
<i>Socrates</i> the wisest of all men living, because he
judiciously made choice of human nature for the object of his
thoughts; an enquiry into which as much exceeds all other learning,
as it is of more consequence to adjust the true nature and measures
of right and wrong, than to settle the distance of the planets, and
compute the times of their circumvolutions.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> 'One good effect that will immediately arise from a
near observation of human nature, is, that we shall cease to wonder
at those actions which men are used to reckon wholly unaccountable;
for as nothing is produced without a cause, so by observing the
nature and course of the passions, we shall be able to trace every
action from its first conceptions to its death.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> 'We shall no more admire at the proceedings of
<i>Cataline</i> and <i>Tiberius</i>, when we know the one was
actuated by a cruel jealousy; the other by a furious ambition; for
the actions of men follow their passions as naturally as light does
heat, or as any other effect flows from its cause; reason must be
employed in adjusting the passions, but they must ever remain the
principles of action.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> 'The strange and absurd variety that is so apparent in
men's actions, shews plainly they can never proceed immediately
from reason; so pure a fountain emits no such troubled waters: they
must necessarily arise from the passions, which are to the mind as
the winds to a ship; they only can move it, and they too often
destroy it; if fair and gentle, they guide it into the harbour; if
contrary and furious, they overset it in the waves.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> 'In the same manner is the mind assisted or endangered
by the passions; reason must then take the place of pilot, and can
never fail of securing her charge if she be not wanting to herself;
the strength of the passions will never be accepted as an excuse
for complying with them: they were designed for subjection; and if
a man suffers them to get the upper hand, he then betrays the
liberty of his own soul.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> 'As nature has framed the several species of beings as
it were in a chain, so man seems to be placed as the middle link
between angels and brutes; hence he participates both of flesh and
spirit by an admirable tye, which in him occasions perpetual war of
passions; and as a man inclines to the angelic or brute part of his
constitution, he is then denominated good or bad, virtuous or
wicked: if love, mercy, and good-nature prevail, they speak him of
the angel; if hatred, cruelly, and envy predominate, they declare
his kindred to the brute.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> 'Hence it was that some ancients imagined, that as men
in this life incline more to the angel or the brute, so after their
death they should transmigrant into the one or the other; and it
would be no unpleasant notion to consider the several species of
brutes, into which we may imagine that tyrants, misers, the proud,
malicious, and ill-natured, might be changed.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> 'As a consequence of this original, all passions are
in all men, but appear not in all: constitution, education, custom
of the, country, reason, and the like causes may improve or abate
the strength of them, but still the seeds remain, which are ever
ready to sprout forth upon the least encouragement.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> 'I have heard a story of a good religious man, who
having been bred with the milk of a goat, was very modest in
public, by a careful reflection he made of his actions, but he
frequently had an hour in secret, wherein he had his frisks and
capers; and, if we had an opportunity of examining the retirement
of the strictest philosophers, no doubt but we should find
perpetual returns of those passions they so artfully conceal from
the public.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> 'I remember <i>Machiavel</i> observes, that every
state should entertain a perpetual jealousy of its neighbours, that
so it should never be unprovided when an emergency happens; in like
manner should reason be perpetually on its guard against the
passions, and never suffer them to carry on any design that may be
destructive of its security; yet, at the same time, it must be
careful, that it don't so far break their strength as to render
them contemptible, and, consequently, itself unguarded.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> 'The understanding being of itself too slow and lazy
to exert itself into action, it is necessary it should be put in
motion by the gentle gales of passion, which may preserve it from
stagnation and corruption; for they are necessary to the help of
the mind, as the circulation of the animal spirits is to the health
of the body; they keep it in life, and strength and vigour: nor is
it possible for the mind to perform its offices without their
assistance; these motions are given us with our being: they are
little spirits, that are born and die with us; to some they are
mild, easy and gentle; to others wayward and unruly; yet never too
strong for the reins of reason, and the guidance of judgment.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> 'We may generally observe a pretty nice proportion,
between the strength of reason and passion; the greatest geniuses
have commonly the strongest affections, as on the other hand, the
weaker understandings have generally the weaker passions: and 'tis
fit the fury of the coursers should not be too great for the
strength of the charioteer.</p>
<p><b>14.</b> 'Young men, whose passions are not a little unruly,
give small hopes of their being considerable; the fire of youth
will of course abate, and is a fault, if it be a fault, that mends
every day; but surely, unless a man has fire in youth, he can
hardly have warmth in old age.</p>
<p><b>15.</b> We must therefore be very cautious, lest while we
think to regulate the passions, we should quite extinguish them;
which is putting out the light of the soul; for to be without
passion, or to be hurried away with it, makes a man equally blind.
The extraordinary severity used in most of our schools has this
fatal effect; it breaks the spring of the mind, and most certainly
destroys more good geniuses than it can possibly improve.</p>
<p><b>16.</b> 'And surely 'tis a mighty mistake that the passions
should be so entirely subdued; for little irregularities are
sometimes not only to be borne with, but to be cultivated too,
since they are frequently attended with the greatest perfections.
All great geniuses have faults mixed with their virtues, and
resemble the flaming bush which has thorns amongst lights.</p>
<p><b>17.</b> 'Since therefore the passions are the principles of
human actions, we must endeavour to manage them so as to retain
their vigour, yet keep them under strict command; we must govern
them rather like free subjects than slaves, lest while we intend to
make them obedient, they become abject, and unfit for those great
purposes to which they were designed.</p>
<p><b>18.</b> 'For my part I must confess, I could never have any
regard to that sect of philosophers, who so much insisted upon an
absolute indifference and vacancy from all passion; for it seems to
me a thing very inconsistent for a man to divest himself of
humanity, in order to acquire tranquility of mind, and to eradicate
the very principles of action, because it is possible they may
produce ill effects.</p>

<p>It is not to be imagined how great an effect well-disposed
lights, with proper forms, and orders in assemblies, have upon some
tempers, I am sure I feel it in so extraordinary a manner, that I
cannot in a day or two get out of my imagination any very beautiful
or disagreeable impression which I receive on such occasions. For
this reason I frequently look in at the play-house, in order to
enlarge my thoughts, and warm my mind with some new ideas, that may
be serviceable to me in my lucubrations.</p>
<p><b>1.</b> In this disposition I entered the theatre the other
day, and placed myself in a corner of it, very convenient for
seeing, without being myself observed. I found the audience hushed
in a very deep attention, and did not question but some noble
tragedy was just then in its crisis, or that an incident was to be
unravelled which would determine the fate of an hero. While I was
in this suspense, expecting every moment to see my old friend Mr.
<i>Bitterton</i> appear in all the majesty of distress, to my
unspeakable amazement, there came up a monster with a face between
his feet; and, as I was looking on, he raised himself on one leg in
such a perpendicular posture, that the other grew in a direct line
above his head.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> It afterwards twisted itself into the motions and
wreathings of several different animals, and, after great variety
of shapes and transformations, went off the stage in the figure of
a human creature. The admiration, the applause, the satisfaction of
the audience, during this strange entertainment, is not to be
expressed. I was very much out of countenance for my dear
countrymen, and looked about with some apprehension, for fear any
foreigner should be present.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> Is it possible, thought I, that human nature can
rejoice in its disgrace, and take pleasure in seeing its own figure
turned into ridicule, and distorted into forms that raise horror
and aversion? There is something disingenuous and immoral in the
being able to bear such a sight. Men of elegant and noble minds are
shocked at the seeing characters of persons who deserve esteem for
their virtue, knowledge, or services to their country, placed in
wrong lights, and by misrepresentations made the subject of
buffoonery.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> Such a nice abhorrence is not, indeed, to be found
among the vulgar; but methinks it is wonderful, that those, who
have nothing but the outward figure to distinguish them as men,
should delight in seeing it abused, vilified and disgraced.</p>
<p>I must confess there is nothing that more pleases me, in all
that I read in books, or see among mankind, than such passages as
represent human nature in its proper dignity.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> As man is a creature made up of different extremes, he
has something in him very great and very mean: a skilful artist may
draw an excellent picture of him in either of these views. The
finest authors of antiquity have taken him on the more advantageous
side. They cultivate the natural grandeur of the soul, raise in her
a generous ambition, feed her with hopes of immortality and
perfection, and do all they can to widen the partition between the
virtuous and the vicious, by making the difference betwixt them as
great as between gods and brutes.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> In short, it is impossible to read a page in
<i>Plato</i>, <i>Tully,</i> and a thousand other ancient moralists,
without being a greater and a better man for it. On the contrary, I
could never read any of our modish <i>French</i> authors, or those
of our own country who are the imitators and admirers of that
trifling nation, without being for some time out of humour with
myself, and at every thing about me.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> Their business is, to depreciate human nature, and
consider it under its worst appearances. They give mean
interpretations and base motives to the worthiest actions; they
resolve virtue and vice into constitution. In short, they endeavour
to make no distinction between man and man, or between the species
of men and that of brutes. As an instance of this kind of authors,
among many others, let any one examine the celebrated
<i>Rochefoucault</i>, who is the great philosopher for
administering of consolation to the idle, the envious, and
worthless parts of mankind.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> I remember a young gentleman of moderate
understanding, but great vivacity, who, by dipping into many
authors of this nature, had got a little smattering of knowledge,
just enough to make an atheist or a free thinker, but not a
philosopher or a man of sense. With these accomplishments, he went
to visit his father in the country, who was a plain, rough, honest
man, and wise though not learned. The son, who took all
opportunities to shew his learning, began to establish a new
religion in the family, and to enlarge the narrowness of their
country notions; in which he succeeded so well, that he had seduced
the butler by his table talk, and staggered his eldest sister.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> The old gentleman began to be alarmed at the schisms
that arose among his children, but did not yet believe his son's
doctrine to be so pernicious as it really was, till one day talking
of his setting-dog, the son said he did not question but
<i>Trey</i> was as immortal as any one of the family; and in the
heat of the argument told his father, that for his own part he
expected to die like a dog. Upon which the old gentleman, starting
up in a very great passion, cried out, Then, sirrah, you shall live
like one; and taking his cane in his hand, cudgeled him out of his
system. This had so good an effect upon him, that he took up from
that day, fell to reading good books, and is now a bencher in the
<i>Middle Temple</i>.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> I do not mention this cudgeling part of the story
with a design to engage the secular arm in matters of this nature;
but certainly, if it ever exerts itself in affairs of opinion and
speculation, it ought to do it on such shallow and despicable
pretenders to knowledge, who endeavour to give man dark and
uncomfortable prospects of his being, and destroy those principles
which are the support, happiness, and glory of all public
societies, as well as private persons.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> I think it is one of <i>Pythagoras's</i> golden
sayings, <i>that a man should take care above all things to have a
due respect for himself</i>; and it is certain, that this
licentious sort of authors, who are for depreciating mankind,
endeavour to disappoint and undo what the most refined spirits have
been labouring to advance since the beginning of the world. The
very design of dress, good-breeding, outward ornaments and
ceremonies, were to lift up human nature, and set it of too
advantage. Architecture, painting, and statuary, were invented with
the same design; as indeed every art and science that contributes
to the embellishment of life, and to the wearing off and throwing
into shades the mean and low parts of our nature.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> Poetry carries on this great end more than all the
rest, as may be seen in the following passages taken out of Sir
<i>Francis Bacon's Advancement of Learning</i>, which gives a true
and better account of this art than all the volumes that were ever
written upon it.</p>
<p>"Poetry, especially heroical, seems to be raised altogether from
a noble foundation, which makes much for the dignity of man's
nature. For seeing this sensible world is in dignity inferior to
the soul of man, poesy seems to endow human nature with that which
history denies; and to give satisfaction to the mind, with at least
the shadow of things, where the substance cannot be had."</p>
<p><b>13.</b> "For if the matter be thoroughly considered, a strong
argument may be drawn from poesy, that a more stately greatness of
things, a more perfect order, and a more beautiful variety,
delights the soul of man than any way can be found in nature since
the fall. Wherefore, seeing the acts and events, which are the
subjects of true history, are not of that amplitude as to content
the mind of man, poesy is ready at hand to feign acts more
heroical."</p>
<p><b>14.</b> "Because true history reports the successes of
business not proportionable to the merit of virtues and vices,
poesy corrects it, and presents events and fortunes according to
desert, and according to the law of Providence: because true
history, through the frequent satiety and similitude of things,
works a distaste and misprision in the mind of man; poesy cheereth
and refresheth the soul, chanting things rare and various, and full
of vicissitudes."</p>
<p><b>15.</b> "So as poesy serveth and conferreth to delectation,
magnanimity and morality; and therefore it may seem deservedly to
have some participation of divineness, because it doth raise the
mind, and exalt the spirit with high raptures, proportioning the
shew of things to the desires of the mind, and not submitting the
mind to things as reason and history do. And by these allurements
and congruities, whereby it cherisheth the soul of man, joined also
with concert of music, whereby it may more sweetly insinuate
itself; it hath won such access, that it hath been in estimation,
even in rude times, among barbarous nations, when our learning
stood excluded."</p>
<p><b>16.</b> But there is nothing which favours and falls in with
this natural greatness and dignity of human nature so much as
religion, which does not only promise the entire refinement of the
mind, but the glorifying of the body, and the immortality of
both.</p>
<br>
<br>
<a name='Custom_a_Second_Nature' id="Custom_a_Second_Nature"></a>
<h2><i>Custom a Second Nature</i>.</h2>
<p><b>1.</b> There is not a common saying which has a better turn
of sense in it than what we often hear in the mouths of the vulgar,
that Custom is a second Nature. It is indeed able to form the man
anew, and give him inclinations and capacities altogether different
from those he was born with.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> Dr. <i>Plot</i>, in his history of
<i>Staffordshire</i>, tells of an idiot, that chancing to live
within the sound of a clock, and always amusing himself with
counting the hour of the day whenever the clock struck: the clock
being spoiled by some accident, the idiot continued to strike and
count the hour without the help of it, in the same manner as he had
done when it was entire.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> Though I dare not vouch for the truth of this story,
it is very certain that custom has a mechanical effect upon the
body, at the same time that it has a very extraordinary influence
upon the mind.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> I shall in this paper consider one very remarkable
effect which custom has upon human nature; and which, if rightly
observed, may lead us into very useful rules of life. What I shall
here take notice of in custom, is its wonderful efficacy in making
every thing pleasant to us.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> A person who is addicted to play or gaming, though he
took but little delight in it at first, by degrees contracts so
strong an inclination towards it, and gives himself up so entirely
to it, that it seems the only end of his being. The love of a
retired or busy life will grow upon a man insensibly, as he is
conversant in the one or the other, till he is utterly unqualified
for relishing that to which he has been for some time disused.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> Nay, a man may smoke or drink, or take snuff, till he
is unable to pass away his time without it; not to mention how our
delight in any particular study, art, or science, rises and
improves in proportion to the application which we bestow upon it.
Thus what was at first an exercise, becomes at length an
entertainment. Our employments are changed into diversions. The
mind grows fond of those actions it is accustomed to, and is drawn
with reluctancy from those paths in which it has been used to
walk.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> Not only such actions as were at first indifferent to
us, but even such as were painful, will by custom and practice
become pleasant.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> Sir <i>Francis Bacon</i> observes in his natural
philosophy, that our taste is never better pleased than with those
things which at first create a disgust in it. He gives particular
instances of claret, coffee, and other liquors; which the palate
seldom approves upon the first taste: but when it has once got a
relish of them, generally retains it for life. The mind is
constituted after the same manner, and after having habituated
itself to any particular exercise or employment, not only loses its
first aversion towards it, but conceives a certain fondness and
affection for it.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> I have heard one of the greatest genuises this age has
produced, who had been trained up in all the polite studies of
antiquity, assure me, upon his being obliged to search into several
rolls and records, that notwithstanding such an employment was at
first very dry and irksome to him, he at last took an incredible
pleasure in it, and preferred it even to the reading of
<i>Virgil</i> or <i>Cicero</i>.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> The reader will observe that I have not here
considered custom as it makes things easy, but as it renders them
delightful; and though others have often made the same reflection,
it is possible they may not have drawn those uses from it, with
which I intend to fill the remaining part of this paper.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> If we consider attentively this property of human
nature, it may instruct us in very fine moralities. In the first
place, I would have no man discouraged with that kind of life or
series of actions, in which the choice of others or his own
necessities may have engaged him. It may perhaps be very
disagreeable to him at first; but use and application will
certainly render it not only less painful, but pleasing and
satisfactory.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> In the second place, I would recommend to every one
the admirable precept which <i>Pythagoras</i> is said to have given
to his disciples, and which that philosopher must have drawn from
the observation I have enlarged upon: <i>Optimum vit&aelig; genus
eligito nam consuctudo facict jucundissimum.</i> Pitch upon that
course of life which is the most excellent, and custom will render
it the most delightful.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> Men, whose circumstances will permit them to choose
their own way of life, are inexcusable if they do not pursue that
which their judgment tells them is the most laudable. The voice of
reason is more to be regarded than the bent of any present
inclination, since by the rule above-mentioned, inclination will at
length come over to reason, though we can never force reason to
comply with inclination.</p>
<p><b>14.</b> In the third place, this observation may teach the
most sensual and irreligious man to overlook those hardships and
difficulties, which are apt to discourage him from the prosecution
of a virtuous life. The Gods, said <i>Hesiod</i>, have placed
labour before virtue; the way to her is at first rough and
difficult, but grows more smooth and easy, the further you advance
in it. The man who proceeds in it, with steadiness and resolution,
will in a little time find that her ways are ways of pleasantness,
and that all her paths are peace.</p>
<p><b>15.</b> To enforce this consideration, we may further
observe, that the practice of religion will not only be attended
with that pleasure which naturally accompanies those actions to
which we are habituated, but with those supernumerary joys of
heart, that rise from the consciousness of such a pleasure, from
the satisfaction of acting up to the dictates of reason, and from
the prospect of an happy immortality.</p>
<p><b>16.</b> In the fourth place, we may learn from this
observation which we have made on the mind of man, to take
particular care, when we are once settled in a regular course of
life, how we too frequently indulge ourselves in any of the most
innocent diversions and entertainments, since the mind may
insensibly fall off from the relish of virtuous actions, and by
degrees, exchange that pleasure which it takes in the performance
of its duty, for delight of a much more inferior and unprofitable
nature.</p>
<p><b>17.</b> The last use which I shall make of this remarkable
property in human nature, of being delighted with those actions to
which it is accustomed, is to shew how absolutely necessary it is
for us to gain habits of virtue in this life, if we would enjoy the
pleasures of the next.</p>
<p><b>18.</b> The state of bliss we call heaven, will not be
capable of affecting those minds, which are not thus qualified for
it: we must in this world gain a relish of truth and virtue, if we
would be able to taste that knowledge and perfection which are to
make us happy in the next. The seeds of those spiritual joys and
raptures, which are to rise up and flourish in the soul to all
eternity, must be planted in it, during this its present state of
probation. In short, heaven is not to be looked upon only as the
reward, but as the natural effect of a religious life.</p>
<p><b>19.</b> On the other hand, those evil spirits, who by long
custom, have contracted in the body, habits of lust, sensuality,
malice and revenge, an aversion to every thing that is good, just,
or laudable, are naturally seasoned and prepared for pain and
misery. Their torments have already taken root in them; they cannot
be happy when divested of the body, unless we may suppose, that
Providence will in a manner create them anew, and work a miracle in
the rectification of their faculties.</p>
<p><b>20.</b> They may, indeed, taste a kind of malignant pleasure
in those actions to which they are accustomed whilst in this life;
but when they are removed from all those objects which are here apt
to gratify them, they will naturally become their own tormentors,
and cherish in themselves those painful habits of mind which are
called, in scripture phrase, the worm which never dies.</p>
<p><b>21.</b> This notion of heaven and hell is so very conformable
to the light of nature, that it was discovered by several of the
most exalted heathens. It has been finely improved by many eminent
divines of the last age, as in particular by Archbishop
<i>Tillotson</i> and Dr. <i>Sherlock</i>; but there is none who has
raised such noble speculations upon it as Dr. <i>Scott</i>, in the
first book of his Christian Life, which is one of the finest and
most rational schemes of divinity, that is written in our tongue or
any other. That excellent author has shewn how every particular
custom and habit of virtue will, in its own nature, produce the
heaven, or a state of happiness, in him who shall hereafter
practise it: as on the contrary, how every custom or habit of vice
will be the natural hell of him in whom it subsists.</p>

<h2><i>On Cleanliness</i>.</h2>
<div style='text-align: right; margin-right: 10%;'>SPECTATOR, No.
631.</div>
<p><b>1.</b> I had occasion to go a few miles out of town, some
days since, in a stage-coach, where I had for my fellow travellers,
a dirty beau, and a pretty young Quaker woman. Having no
inclination to talk much at that time, I placed myself backward,
with a design to survey them, and pick a speculation out of my two
companions. Their different figures were suificient of themselves
to draw my attention.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> The gentleman was dressed in a suit, the ground
whereof had been black, as I perceived from some few spaces that
had escaped the powder, which was incorporated with the greatest
part of his coat; his periwig, which cost no smull sum, was after
so slovenly a manner cast over his shoulders, that it seemed not to
have been combed since the year 1712; his linen, which was not much
concealed, was daubed with plain Spanish from the chin to the
lowest button, and the diamond upon his finger (which naturally
dreaded the water) put me in mind how it sparkled amidst the
rubbish of the mine where it was first discovered.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> On the other hand, the pretty Quaker appeared in all
the elegance of cleanliness. Not a speck was to be found on her. A
clear, clean, oval face, just edged about with little thin plaits
of the purest cambrick, received great advantages from the shade of
her black hood: as did the whiteness of her arms from that
sober-coloured stuff in which she had clothed herself. The
plainness of her dress was very well suited to the simplicity of
her phrases, all which put together, though they could not give me
a great opinion of her religion, they did of her innocence.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> This adventure occasioned my throwing together a few
hints upon <i>cleanliness</i>, which I shall consider as one of the
half virtues, as <i>Aristotle</i> calls them, and shall recommend
it under the three following heads: As it is a mark of politeness;
as it produceth love; and as it bears analogy to purity of
mind.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> First, it is a mark of politeness. It is universally
agreed upon, that no one, unadorned with this virtue, can go into
company without giving a manifest offence. The easier or higher any
one's fortune is, this duty rises proportionably. The different
nations of the world are as much distinguished by their
cleanliness, as by their arts and sciences. The more any country is
civilized, the more they consult this part of politeness. We need
but compare our ideas of a female <i>Hottentot</i> with an
<i>English</i> beauty, to be; satisfied with the truth of what hath
been advanced.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> In the next place, cleanliness may be said to be the
foster-mother of love. Beauty, indeed, most commonly produces that
passion in the mind, but cleanliness preserves it. An indifferent
face and person, kept in perpetual neatness, hath won many a heart
from a pretty slattern. Age itself is not unamiable, while it is
preserved clean and unsullied: like a piece of metal constantly
kept smooth and bright, we look on it with more pleasure than on a
new vessel that is cankered with rust.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> I might observe further, that as cleanliness renders
us agreeable to others, so it makes it easy to ourselves; that it
is an excellent preservative of health; and that several vices,
destructive both to mind and body, are inconsistent with the habit
of it. But these reflections I shall leave to the leisure of my
readers, and shall observe in the third place, that it bears a
great analogy with purity of mind, and naturally inspires refined
sentiments and passions.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> We find, from experience, that through the prevalence
of custom, the most vicious actions lose their horror, by being
made familiar to us. On the contrary, those who live in the
neighbourhood of good examples, fly from the first appearances of
what is shocking. It fares with us much after the same manner as
our ideas. Our senses, which are the inlets to all the images
conveyed to the mind, can only transmit the impression of such
things as usually surround them; so that pure and unsullied
thoughts are naturally suggested to the mind, by those objects that
perpetually encompass us, when they are beautiful and elegant in
their kind.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> In the East, where the warmth of the climates makes
cleanliness more immediately necessary than in colder countries, it
is made one part of their religion; the Jewish law (and the
Mahometan, which, in somethings, copies after it) is filled with
bathings, purifications, and other rites of the like nature. Though
there is the above named convenient reason to be assigned for these
ceremonies, the chief intention, undoubtedly, was to typify inward
purity and cleanliness of heart by those outward washings.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> We read several injunctions of this kind in the book
of Deuteronomy, which confirms this truth, and which are but ill
accounted for by saying, as some do, that they were only instituted
for convenience in the desert, which otherways could not have been
habitable, for so many years.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> I shall conclude this essay with a story which I have
some where read in an account of Mahometan superstition. A dervise
of great sanctity one morning had the misfortune, as he took up a
crystal cup, which was consecrated to the prophet, to let it fall
upon the ground and dash it in pieces. His son coming in some time
after, he stretched out his hand to bless him, as his manner was
every morning; but the youth going out stumbled over the threshold
and broke his arm. As the old man wondered at those events, a
caravan passed by in its way from <i>Mecca</i>. The dervise
approached it to beg a blessing; but as he stroked one of the holy
camels, he received a kick from the beast, that sorely bruised him.
His sorrow and amazement increased upon him, till he recollected,
that, through hurry and inadvertency, he had that morning come
abroad without washing his hands.</p>

<a name='The_Advantages_of_a_good_Education' id=
"The_Advantages_of_a_good_Education"></a>
<h2><i>The Advantages of a good Education</i>.</h2>
<p><b>1.</b> I consider a human soul without education like marble
in the quarry, which shews none of its inherent beauties, until the
skill of the polisher fetches out the colours, makes the surface
shine, and discovers every ornamental cloud, spot and vein, that
runs through the body of it. Education, after the same manner, when
it works, upon a noble mind, draws out to view every latent virtue
and perfection, which, without such helps, are never able to make
their appearance.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> If my reader will give me leave to change the allusion
so soon upon him, I shall make use of the same instance to
illustrate the force of education, which <i>Aristotle</i> has
brought to explain his doctrine of substantial forms, when he tells
us that a statue lies hid in a block of marble; and that the art of
the statuary only clears away the superfluous matter, and removes
the rubbish. The figure is in the stone, the sculptor only finds
it. What sculpture is to a block of marble, education is to an
human soul.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> The philosopher, the saint, or the hero, the wise, the
good, or the great man, very often lie hid and concealed in a
plebeian, which a proper education might have disinterred, and have
brought to light. I am therefore much delighted with reading the
accounts of savage nations, and with contemplating those virtues
which are wild and uncultivated; to see courage exerting itself in
fierceness, resolution in obstinacy, wisdom in cunning, patience in
sullenness and despair.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> Men's passions operate variously, and appear in
different kinds of actions, according as they are more or less
rectified or swayed by reason. When one hears of negroes, who upon
the death of their masters, or upon changing their service, hang
themselves upon the next tree, as it frequently happens in our
American plantations, who can forbear admiring their fidelity,
though it expresses itself in so dreadful a manner?</p>
<p><b>5.</b> What might not that savage greatness of soul which
appears in these poor wretches on many occasions, be raised to,
were it rightly cultivated? And what colour of excuse can there be
for the contempt with which we treat this part of our species? that
we should not put them upon the common foot of humanity; that we
should only set an insignificant fine upon the man who murders
them; nay, that we should, as much as in us lies, cut them off from
the prospect of happiness in another world, as well as in this, and
deny them that which we look upon as the proper means for attaining
it.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> It is therefore an unspeakable blessing to be born in
those parts of the world where wisdom and knowledge flourish,
though it must be confessed there are, even in these parts, several
poor uninstructed persons, who are but little above the inhabitants
of those nations of which I have been here speaking; as those who
have had the advantages of a more liberal education, rise above one
another by several different degrees of perfection.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> For, to return to our statue in the block of marble,
we see it sometimes only begun to be chipped, sometimes sough hewn,
and but just sketched into an human figure; sometimes we see the
man appearing distinctly in all his limbs and features, sometimes
we find the figure wrought up to a great elegancy, but seldom meet
with any to which the hand of <i>Phidias</i> or <i>Prixiteles</i>
could not give several nice touches and finishings.</p>

<a name='The_Disadvantages_of_a_bad_Education' id=
"The_Disadvantages_of_a_bad_Education"></a>
<h2><i>The Disadvantages of a bad Education.</i></h2>
<br>
<p>SIR,</p>
<p><b>1.</b> I was condemned by some disastrous influence to be an
only son, born to the apparent prospect of a large fortune, and
allotted to my parents at that time of life when satiety of common
diversions allows the mind to indulge parental affection with great
intenseness. My birth was celebrated by the tenants with feasts and
dances and bagpipes; congratulations were sent from every family
within ten miles round; and my parents discovered in my first cries
such tokens of future virtue and understanding, that they declared
themselves determined to devote the remaining part of life to my
happiness and the increase of their estate.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> The abilities of my father and mother were not
perceptibly unequal, and education had given neither much advantage
over the other. They had both kept good company, rattled in
chariots, glittered in play-houses, and danced at court, and were
both expert in the games that were in their times called in as
auxiliaries against the intrusion of thought.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> When there is such a parity between two persons
associated for life, the dejection which the husband, if he be not
completely stupid, must always suffer for want of superiority,
sinks him to submissiveness. My mamma therefore governed the family
without control; and except that my father still retained some
authority in the stables, and now and then, after a supernumery
bottle, broke a looking-glass, or china-dish, to prove his
sovereignty, the whole course of the year was regulated by her
direction; the servants received from her all their orders, and the
tenants were continued or dismissed at her discretion.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> She therefore thought herself entitled to the
superintendance of her son's education; and when my father, at the
instigation of the parson, faintly proposed that I should be sent
to school, very positively told him, that she would not suffer so
fine a child to be ruined: that she never knew any boys at a
grammar-school that could come into a room without blushing, or set
at the table without some awkward uneasiness; that they were always
putting themselves into danger by boisterous plays, or vitiating
their behaviour with mean company; and that for her part, she would
rather follow me to the grave than see me tear my clothes, and hang
down my head, and sneak about with dirty shoes and blotted fingers,
my hair unpowdered, and my hat uncocked.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> My father, who had no other end in his proposal than
to appear wise and manly, soon acquiesced, since I was not to live
by my learning; for indeed he had known very few students that had
not some stiffness in their manner. They therefore agreed that a
domestic tutor should be procured, and hired an honest gentleman of
mean conversation and narrow sentiments, but who having passed the
common forms of literary education, they implicitly concluded
qualified to teach all that was to be learned from a scholar. He
thought himself sufficiently exalted by being placed at the same
table with his pupil, and had no other view than to perpetuate his
felicity by the utmost flexibility of submission to all my mother's
opinions and caprices. He frequently took away my book, lest I
should mope with too much application, charged me never to write
without turning up my ruffles, and generally brushed my coat before
he dismissed me into the parlour.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> He had no occasion to complain of too burthensome an
employment; for my mother very judiciously considered that I was
not likely to grow politer in his company, and suffered me not to
pass any more time in his apartment, than my lesson required. When
I was summoned to my task, she enjoined me not to get any of my
tutor's ways, who was seldom mentioned before me but for practices
to be avoided. I was every moment admonished not to lean on my
chair, cross my legs, or swing my hands like my tutor; and once my
mother very seriously deliberated upon his total dismission,
because I began, said she, to learn his manner of sticking on my
hat, and had his bend in my shoulders, and his totter in my
gait.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> Such, however, was her care, that I escaped all these
depravities, and when I was only twelve years old, had rid myself
of every appearance of childish diffidence. I was celebrated round
the country for the petulence of my remarks, and the quickness of
my replies; and many a scholar five years older than myself, have I
dashed into confusion by the steadiness of my countenance, silenced
by my readiness of repartee, and tortured with envy by the address
with which I picked up a fan, presented a snuff-box, or received an
empty tea-cup.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> At fourteen I was completely skilled in all the
niceties of dress, and I could not only enumerate all the variety
of silks, and distinguish the product of a French loom, but dart my
eye through a numerous company, and observe every deviation from
the reigning mode. I was universally skilful in all the changes of
expensive finery; but as every one, they say, has something to
which he is particularly born, was eminently known in Brussels
lace.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> The next year saw me advanced to the trust and power
of adjusting the ceremonial of an assembly. All received their
partners from my hand, and to me every stranger applied for
introduction. My heart now disdained the instructions of a tutor,
who was rewarded with a small annuity for life, and left me
qualified, in my own opinion, to govern myself.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> In a short time I came to London, and as my father
was well known among the higher classes of life, soon; obtained
admission to the most splendid assemblies, and most crowded
card-tables. Here I found myself universally caressed and
applauded, the ladies praised the fancy of my clothes, the beauty
of my form, and the softness of my voice; endeavoured in every
place to force themselves to my notice; and incited, by a thousand
oblique solicitations, my attendance at the play-house, and my
salutations in the park. I was now happy to the utmost extent of my
conception; I passed every morning in dress, every afternoon in
visits, and every night in some select assemblies, where neither
care nor knowledge were suffered to molest us.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> After a few years, however, these delights became
familiar, and I had leisure to look round me with more attention. I
then found that my flatterers had very little power to relieve the
languor of satiety, or recreate weariness by varied amusement; and
therefore endeavoured to enlarge the sphere of my pleasures, and to
try what satisfaction might be found in the society of men. I will
not deny the mortification with which I perceived that every man
whose name I had heard mentioned with respect, received me with a
kind of tenderness nearly bordering on compassion; and that those
whose reputation was not well established, thought it necessary to
justify their understandings, by treating me with contempt. One of
these witlings elevated his crest by asking me in a full
coffee-house the price of patches; and another whispered, that he
wondered Miss <i>Frisk</i> did not keep me that afternoon to watch
her squirrel.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> When I found myself thus hunted from all masculine
conversation by those who were themselves barely admitted, I
returned to the ladies, and resolved to dedicate my life to their
service and their pleasure. But I find that I have now lost my
charms. Of those with whom I entered the gay world, some are
married, some have retired, and some have so much changed their
opinion, that they scarcely pay any regard to my civilities, if
there is any other man in the place. The new flight of beauties to
whom I have made my addresses, suffer me to pay the treat, and then
titter with boys: So that I now find myself welcome only to a few
grave ladies, who, unacquainted with all that gives either use or
dignity to life, are content to pass their hours between their bed
and their cards, without esteem from the old, or reverence from the
young.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> I cannot but think, Mr. <i>Rambler</i>, that I have
reason to complain; for surely the females ought to pay some regard
to the age of him whose youth was passed in endeavouring to please
them. They that encourage folly in the boy, have no right to punish
it in the man. Yet I find, that though they lavish their first
fondness upon pertness and gaiety, they soon transfer their regard
to other qualities, and ungratefully abandon their adorers to dream
out their last years in stupidity and contempt.</p>

<br>
<div style='text-align: right; margin-right: 10%;'>GUARDIAN, No.
155.</div>
<p><b>1.</b> I have often wondered that learning is not thought a
proper ingredient in the education of a woman of quality or
fortune. Since they have the same improveable minds as the male
part of the species, why should they not be cultivated, by the same
method? Why should reason be left to itself in one of the sexes,
and be disciplined with so much care to the other?</p>
<p><b>2.</b> There are some reasons why learning seems more adapted
to the female world than to the male. As in the first place,
because they have more spare time upon their hands, and lead a more
sedentary life. Their employments are of a domestic nature, and not
like those of the other sex, which are often inconsistent with
study and contemplation.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> The excellent lady, the lady <i>Lizard</i>, in the
space of one summer furnished a gallery with chairs and couches of
her own and her daughters working; and at the same time heard all
Dr. <i>Tillotson's</i> sermons twice over. It is always the custom
for one of the young ladies to read, while the others are at work;
so that the learning of the family is not at all prejudicial to its
manufactures.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> I was mightily pleased the other day to find them all
busy in preserving several fruits of the season, with the Sparkler
in the midst of them, reading over "The plurality of Worlds." It
was very entertaining to me to see them dividing their speculations
between jellies and stars, and making a sudden transition from the
sun to an apricot, or from the Copernicum system to the figure of a
cheese cake.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> A second reason why women should apply themselves to
useful knowledge rather than men, is because they have that natural
gift of speech in greater perfection. Since they have so excellent
a talent, such a <i>Copia Verborum</i>, or plenty of words, it is
pity they should not put it to some use. If the female tongue will
be in motion, why should it not be set to go right? Could they
discourse about the spots in the sun, it might divert them from
publishing the faults of their neighbours: could they talk of the
different aspects and conjunctions of the planets, they need not be
at the pains to comment upon oglings and clandestine marriages. In
short, were they furnished with matters of fact, out of arts and
sciences, it would now and then be of great ease to their
invention.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> There is another reason why those, especially who are
women of quality, should apply themselves to letters, namely,
because their husbands are generally strangers to them. It is great
pity there should by no knowledge in a family. For my own part, I
am concerned when I go into a great house, where perhaps there is
not a single person that can spell, unless it be by chance the
butler, or one of the foot-men. What a figure is the young heir
likely to make, who is a dunce both by father and mother's
side?</p>
<p><b>7.</b> If we look into the histories of famous women, we find
many eminent philosophers of this sex. Nay, we find that several
females have distinguished themselves in those sects of philosophy
which seem almost repugnant to their natures. There have been
famous female <i>Pythagorians</i>, notwithstanding most of that
philosophy consisted in keeping a secret, and that the disciple was
to hold her tongue five years together.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> Learning and knowledge are perfections in us, not as
we are men, but as we are reasonable creatures, in which order of
beings the female world is upon the same level with the male. We
ought to consider in this particular, not what is the sex, but what
is the species to which they belong. At least I believe every one
will allow me, that a female philosopher is not so absurd a
character, and so opposite to the sex, as a female gamester; and
that it is more irrational for a woman to pass away half a dozen
hours at cards or dice, than in getting up stores of useful
learning.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> This, therefore, is another reason why I would
recommend the studies of knowledge to the female world, that they
may not be at a loss how to employ those hours that lie heavy upon
their hands.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> I might also add this motive to my fair readers, that
several of their sex, who have improved their minds by books and
literature, have raised themselves to the highest posts of honour
and fortune. A neighbouring nation may at this time furnish us with
a very remarkable instance of this kind: but I shall conclude this
head with the history of Athenais, which is a very signal example
to my present purpose.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> The Emperor Theodosius being about the age of
one-and-twenty, and designing to take a wife, desired his sister
Pulcheria and his friend Paulinus to search his whole empire for a
woman of the most exquisite beauty and highest accomplishments. In
the midst of this search, Athenais, a Grecian virgin, accidentally
offered herself. Her father, who was an eminent philosopher of
Athens, and had bred her up in all the learning of that place, at
his death left her but a very small portion, in which also she
suffered great hardships from the injustice of her two
brothers.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> This forced her upon a journey to Constantinople,
where she had a relation who represented her case to Pulcheria, in
order to obtain some redress from the emperor. By this means that
religious princess became acquainted with Athenais; whom she found
the most beautiful woman of her age, and educated under a long
course of philosophy, in the strictest virtue and most unspotted
innocence.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> Pulcheria was charmed with her conversation, and
immediately made her report to the emperor her brother Theodosius.
The character she gave made such an impression on him, that he
desired his sister to bring her away immediately to the lodgings of
his friend Paulinus, where he found her beauty and her conversation
beyond the highest idea he had framed of them.</p>
<p><b>14.</b> His friend Paulinus converted her to christianity,
and gave her the name of Eudosia; after which the emperor publicly
espoused her, and enjoyed all the happiness in his marriage which
he promised himself from such a virtuous and learned bride. She not
only forgave the injuries which her two brothers had done her, but
raised them to great honours; and by several works of learning, as
well as by an exemplary life, made herself so dear to the whole
empire, that she had many statues erected to her memory, and is
celebrated by the fathers of the church as an ornament of her
sex.</p>

<br>
<div style='text-align: right; margin-right: 10%;'>SPECTATOR.</div>
<p><b>1.</b> Going yesterday to dine with an old acquaintance, I
had the misfortune to find the whole family very much dejected.
Upon asking him the occasion of it, he told me that his wife had
dreamed a very strange dream the night before, which they were
afraid portended some mischief to themselves or to their children.
At her coming into the room, I observed a settled melancholy in her
countenance, which I should have been troubled for, had I not heard
from whence it proceeded.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> We were no sooner sat down, but, after having looked
upon me a little while, 'My dear,' says she, turning to her
husband, 'you may now see the stranger that was in the candle last
night.' Soon after this, as they began to talk of family affairs, a
little boy at the lower end of the table told her, that he was to
go into joining-hand on Thursday&mdash;'Thursday!' says she, 'no,
child, if it please God, you shall not begin upon Childermas day;
tell your writing-master that Friday will be soon enough.'</p>
<p><b>3.</b> I was reflecting with myself on the oddness of her
fancy, and wondering that any body would establish it as a rule to
lose a day in every week. In the midst of these my musings, she
desired me to reach her a little salt upon the point of my knife,
which I did in such a trepidation and hurry of obedience, that I
let it drop by the way; at which she immediately startled, and said
it fell towards her. Upon which I looked very blank; and, observing
the concern of the whole table, began to consider myself, with some
confusion, as a person that had brought a disaster upon the
family.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> The lady, however, recovering herself after a little
space, said to her husband with a sigh, 'My dear, misfortunes never
come single.' My friend, I found, acted but an under-part at his
table, and being a man of more good-nature than understanding,
thinks himself obliged to fall in with all the passions and humours
of his yoke-fellow: 'Do you remember, child,' says she, 'that the
pigeon-house fell the very afternoon that our careless wench spilt
the salt upon the table?' 'Yes,' says he, 'my dear, and the next
post brought us an account of the battle of Almanza.'</p>
<p><b>5.</b> The reader may guess at the figure I made, after
having done all this mischief. I dispatched my dinner as soon as I
could, with my usual taciturnity; when, to my utter confusion, the
lady seeing me quitting my knife and fork, and laying across one
another upon my plate, desired me that I would humour her so far as
to take them out of that figure, and place them side by side.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> What the absurdity was which I had committed I did not
know, but I suppose there was some traditionary superstition in it;
and therefore, in obedience to the lady of the house, I disposed of
my knife and fork in two parallel lines, which is a figure I shall
always lay them in for the future, though I do not know any reason
for it.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> It is not difficult to a man to see that a person has
conceived an aversion to him. For my own part, I quickly found, by
the lady's looks, that she regarded me as a very odd kind of
fellow, with an unfortunate aspect; for which reason I took my
leave immediately after dinner, and withdrew to my own
lodgings.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> Upon my return home, I fell into a profound
contemplation on the evils that attend these superstitious follies
of mankind: how they subject us to imaginary afflictions and
additional sorrows that do not properly come within our lot. As if
the natural calamities of life were not sufficient for it, we turn
the most indifferent circumstances into misfortunes, and suffer as
much from trifling accidents, as from real evils.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> I have known the shooting of a star spoil a night's
rest; and have seen a man in love grow pale and lose his appetite,
upon the plucking of a merry-thought. A screech owl at midnight has
alarmed a family more than a band of robbers; nay, the voice of a
cricket hath struck more terror than the roaring of a lion.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> There is nothing so inconsiderable, which may not
appear dreadful to an imagination that is filled with omens and
prognostics. A rusty nail, or crooked pin, shoot up into
prodigies.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> I remember I was once in a mixt assembly, that was
full of noise and mirth, when on a sudden an old woman unluckily
observed there were thirteen of us in company. This remark struck a
panic terror into several who were present, insomuch that one or
two of the ladies were going to leave the room; but a friend of
mine taking notice that one of our female companions was big with
child, affirmed there were fourteen in the room, and that, instead
of portending one of the company should die, it plainly foretold
one of them should be born. Had not my friend found out this
expedient to break the omen, I question not but half the women in
the company would have fallen sick that very night.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> An old maid, that is troubled with the vapours,
produces infinite disturbances of this kind among her friends and
neighbours. I know a maiden aunt, of a great family, who is one of
these antiquated Sibyls, that forebodes and prophesies from one end
of the year to the other. She is always seeing apparitions, and
hearing dead-watches; and was the other day almost frightened out
of her wits by the great house-dog, that howled in the stable at a
time when she lay ill of the tooth-ache.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> Such an extravagant cast of mind engages multitudes
of people not only in impertinent terrors, but in supernumerary
duties of life; and arises from that fear and ignorance which are
natural to the soul of man.</p>
<p><b>14.</b> The horror with which we entertain the thoughts of
death (or indeed of any future evil) and the uncertainty of its
approach, fill a melancholy mind with innumerable apprehensions and
suspicions, and consequently dispose it to the observation of such
groundless prodigies and predictions. For as it is the chief
concern of wise men, to retrench the evils of life by the
reasonings of philosophy; it is the employment of fools to multiply
them by the sentiments of superstition.</p>
<p><b>15.</b> For my own part, I should be very much troubled were
I endowed with this divining quality, though it should inform me
truly of every thing that can befal me. I would not anticipate the
relish of any happiness, nor feel the weight of any misery, before
it actually arrives.</p>
<p><b>16.</b> I know but one way of fortifying my soul against
these gloomy presages and terrors of mind; and that is, by securing
to myself the friendship and protection of that Being, who disposes
of events and governs futurity. He sees, at one view, the whole
thread of my existence, not only that part of it which I have
already passed through, but that which runs forward into all the
depths of eternity.</p>
<p><b>17.</b> When I lay me down to sleep, I recommend myself to
his care; when I awake, I give myself up to his direction. Amidst
all the evils that threaten me, I will look up to him for help, and
question not but he will either avert them, or turn them to my
advantage. Though I know neither the time nor the manner of the
death I am to die, I am not at all solicitous about it; because I
am sure that he knows them both, and that he will not fail to
comfort and support me under them.</p>

<h2><i>A good Conscience the best Security against Calumny and
Reproach</i>.</h2>
<div style='text-align: right; margin-right: 10%;'>GUARDIAN, No.
135.</div>
<p><b>1.</b> A good conscience is to the soul what health is to the
body; it preserves a constant ease and serenity within us, and move
than countervails all the calamities and afflictions which can
possibly befal us. I know nothing so hard for a generous mind to
get over as calumny and reproach, and cannot find any method of
quieting the soul under them, besides this single one, of our being
conscious to ourselves that we do not deserve them.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> I have been always mightily pleased with that passage
in Don Quixotte, where the fantastical knight is represented as
loading a gentleman of good sense with praises and eulogiums. Upon
which the gentleman makes this reflection to himself: how grateful
is praise to human nature!</p>
<p><b>3.</b> I cannot forbear being secretly pleased with the
commendations I receive, though, I am sensible, it is a madman who
bestows them on me. In the same manner, though we are often sure
that the censures which are passed upon us, are uttered by those
who know nothing of us, and have neither means nor abilities to
form a right judgment of us, we cannot forbear being grieved at
what they say.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> In order to heal this infirmity, which is so natural
to the best and wisest of men, I have taken a particular pleasure
in observing the conduct of the old philosophers, how they bore
themselves up against the malice and detraction of their
enemies.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> The way to silence calumny, says <i>Bias</i>, is to be
always exercised in such things as are praise-worthy.
<i>Socrates</i>, after having received sentence, told his friends
that he had always accustomed himself to regard truth and not
censure, and that he was not troubled at his condemnation, because
he knew himself free from guilt. It was in the same spirit that he
heard the accusations of his two great adversaries, who had uttered
against him the most virulent reproaches.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> <i>Anytus</i> and <i>Melitus</i>, says he, may procure
sentence against me, but they cannot hurt me. This divine
philosopher was so well fortified in his own innocence, that he
neglected all the impotence of evil tongues which were engaged in
his destruction. This was properly the support of a good
conscience, that contradicted the reports which had been raised
against him, and cleared him to himself.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> Others of the philosophers rather chose to retort the
injury of a smart reply, than thus to disarm it with respect to
themselves. They shew that it stung them, though at the same time
they had the address to make their aggressors suffer with them. Of
this kind is <i>Aristotle's</i> reply to one who pursued him with
long and bitter invectives. You, says he, who are used to suffer
reproaches, utter them with delight; I who have not been used to
utter them, take no pleasure in hearing them.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> Diogenes was still more severe on one who spoke ill of
him: nobody will believe you when you speak ill of me, any more
than they would believe me when I speak well of you.</p>
<p>In these and many other instances I could produce, the
bitterness of the answer sufficiently testifies the uneasiness of
mind the person was under who made it.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> I would rather advise my reader, if he has not in this
case the secret consolation, that he deserves no such reproaches as
are cast upon him, to follow the advice of Epictetus: If any one
speaks ill of thee, consider whether he has truth on his side; and
if so, reform thyself that his censures may not affect thee.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> When Anaximander was told that the very boys laughed
at his singing: Ay, says he, then I must learn to sing better. But
of all the sayings of philosophers which I have gathered together
for my own use on this occasion, there are none which carry in them
more candour and good sense than the two following ones of
Plato.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> Being told that he had many enemies who spoke ill of
him; it is no matter, said he, I will live so that none shall
believe them. Hearing at another time, that an intimate friend of
his had spoken detractingly of him, I am sure he would not do it,
says he, if he had not some reason for it.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> This is the surest as well as the noblest way of
drawing the sting out of a reproach, and a true method of preparing
a man for that great and only relief against the pains of calumny,
'a good conscience.'</p>
<p><b>13.</b> I designed in this essay; to shew, that there is no
happiness wanting to him who is possessd of this excellent frame of
mind, and that no one can be miserable who is in the enjoyment of
it; but I find this subject so well treated in one of Dr. Soulh's
sermons, that I shall fill this Saturday's paper with a passage of
it, which cannot but make the man's heart burn within him, who
reads it with due attention.</p>
<p><b>14.</b> That admirable author, having shewn the virtue of a
good conscience, in supporting a man under the greatest trials and
difficulties of life, concludes with representing its force and
efficacy in the hour of death.</p>
<p><b>15.</b> The third and last instance, in which above all
others this confidence towards God does most eminently shew and
exert itself, is at the time of death; which surely gives the grand
opportunity of trying both the strength and worth of every
principle.</p>
<p><b>16.</b> When a man shall be just about to quit the stage of
this world, to put off his mortality, and to deliver up his last
accounts to God; at which sad time his memory shall serve him for
little else, but to terrify him with a frightful review of his past
life, and his former extravagancies stripped of all their pleasure,
but retaining their guilt; what is it then that can promise him a
fair passage into the other world, or a comfortable appearance
before his dreadful Judge when he is there?</p>
<p><b>17.</b> Not all the friends and interests, all the riches and
honours under heaven can speak so much as a word for him, or one
word of comfort to him in that condition; they may possibly
reproach, but they cannot relieve him.</p>
<p><b>18.</b> No, at this disconsolate time, when the busy temper
shall be more than usually apt to vex and trouble him, and the
pains of a dying body to hinder and discompose him, and the
settlement of worldly affairs to disturb and confound him; and in a
word, all things conspire to make his sick-bed grievous and uneasy:
nothing can then stand up against all these ruins, and speak life
in the midst of death, but a clear conscience.</p>
<p><b>19.</b> And the testimony of that shall make the comforts of
heaven descend upon his weary head, like a refreshing dew, or
shower upon a parched ground. It shall give him some lively
earnests, and secret anticipations of his approaching joy. It shall
bid his, soul to go out of the body undauntedly, and lift up his
head with confidence before saints and angels. Surely the comfort,
which it conveys at this season, is something bigger than the
capacities of mortality, mighty and unspeakable, and not to be
understood till it comes to be felt.</p>
<p><b>20.</b> And now who would not quit all the pleasures, and
trash, and trifles, which are apt to captivate the heart of man,
and pursue the great rigours of piety, and austerities of a good
life, to purchase to himself such a conscience, as at the hour of
death, when all the friendship in the world shall bid him adieu,
and the whole creation turns its back upon him, shall dismiss the
soul and close his eyes with that blessed sentence, 'Well done thou
good and faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy
Lord.'</p>

<h2><i>On Contentment</i>.</h2>
<div style='text-align: right; margin-right: 10%;'>SPECTATOR, No.
574.</div>
<p><b>1.</b> I was once engaged in discourse with a Rosicrucian
about the <i>great secret</i>. As this kind of men (I mean those of
them who are not professed cheats) are over-run with enthusiasm and
philosophy, it was very amusing to hear this religious adept
descanting on his pretended discovery. He talked of the secret as
of a spirit which lived within an emerald, and converted every
thing that was near it to the highest perfection it is capable
of.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> It gives a lustre, says he, to the sun, and water to
the diamond. It irradiates every metal, and enriches lead with all
the properties of gold. It heightens smoke into flame, flame into
light, and light into glory. He further added, that a single ray of
it dissipates pain, and care, and melancholy, from the person on
whom it falls. In short, says he, its presence naturally changes
every place into a kind of heaven.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> After he had gone on for some time in this
unintelligible cant, I found that he jumbled natural and moral
ideas together in the same discourse, and that his great secret was
nothing else but content.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> This virtue does indeed produce, in some measure, all
those effects which the alchymist usually ascribes to what he calls
the philosopher's stone; and if it does not bring riches, it does
the same thing, by banishing the desire of them. If it cannot
remove the disquietudes arising out of a man's mind, body or
fortune, it makes him easy under them. It has indeed a kindly
influence on the soul of man, in respect of every thing to whom he
stands related. It extinguishes all murmur, repining and
ingratitude towards that Being who has allotted him his part to act
in this world. It destroys all inordinate ambition, and every
tendency to corruption, with regard to the community wherein he is
placed. It gives sweetness to his conversation, and a perpetual
serenity to all his thoughts.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> Among the many methods which might be made use of for
the acquiring of this virtue, I shall only mention the two
following: First of all, a man should always consider how much more
unhappy he might be than he really is.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> First of all, a man should always consider how much
more he has than he wants. I am wonderfully pleased with the reply
which Aristippus made to one who condoled him upon the loss of a
farm: Why, said he, I have three farms still, and you have but one;
so that I ought rather to be afflicted for you than you for me. On
the contrary, foolish men are more apt to consider what they have
lost than what they possess; and to fix their eyes upon those who
are richer than themselves, rather than on those who are under
greater difficulties.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> All the real pleasures and conveniences of life lie in
a narrow compass; but it is the humour of mankind, to be always
looking forward, and straining after one who has got the start of
them in wealth and honour. For this reason, as there are none can
be properly called rich, who have not more than they want; there
are few rich men in any of the politer nations but among the middle
sort of people, who keep their wishes within their fortunes, and
have more wealth than they know how to enjoy.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> Persons in a higher rank live in a kind of splendid
poverty; and are perpetually wanting, because, instead of
acquiescing in the solid pleasures of life, they endeavour to
outvie one another in shadows and appearances. Men of sense have at
all times beheld with a great deal of mirth this silly game that is
playing over their heads, and by contracting their desires enjoy
all that secret satisfaction which others are always in quest
of.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> The truth is, this ridiculous chase after imaginary
pleasures cannot be sufficiently exposed, as it is the great source
of those evils which generally undo a nation. Let a man's estate be
what it will, he is a poor man if he does not live within it, and
naturally sets himself to sale to any one that can give him his
price.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> When Pitticus, after the death of his brother, who
had left him a good estate, was offered a greater sum of money by
the king of Lydia, he thanked him for his kindness, but told him he
had already more by half than he knew what to do with. In short,
content is equivalent to wealth, and luxury to poverty; or, to give
the thought a more agreeable turn, 'Content is natural wealth,'
says Socrates; to which I shall add, 'Luxury is artificial
poverty.'</p>
<p><b>11.</b> I shall therefore recommend to the consideration of
those who are always aiming after superfluous and imaginary
enjoyments, and will not be at the trouble of contracting their
desires, an excellent saying of Bion the philosopher; namely, 'That
no man has so much care as he who endeavours after the most
happiness.'</p>
<p><b>12.</b> In the second place, every one ought to reflect how
much more unhappy he might be than he really is. The former
consideration took in all those who are sufficiently provided with
the means to make themselves easy; this regards such as actually
lie under some pressure or misfortune.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> These may receive a great alleviation from such a
comparison as the unhappy person may make between himself and
others, or between the misfortunes which he suffers, and greater
misfortunes which might have befallen him.</p>
<p><b>14.</b> I like the story of the honest Dutchman, who upon
breaking his leg by a fall from the main-mast, told the
standers-by, it was a great mercy that it was not his neck. To
which, since I am got into quotations, give me leave to add the
saying of an old philosopher, who, after having invited some of his
friends to dine with him, was ruffled by his wife that came into
the room in a passion and threw down the table that stood before
them; 'Every one, says he, has his calamity, and he is a happy man
that has no greater than this.'</p>
<p><b>15.</b> We find an instance to the same purpose in the life
of Doctor Hammond, written by Bishop Fell. As this good man was
troubled with a complication of distempers, when he had the gout
upon him, he used to thank God that it was not the stone; and when
he had the stone, that he had not both these distempers on him at
the same time.</p>
<p><b>16.</b> I cannot conclude this essay without observing, that
there was never any system besides that of christianity, which
could effectually produce in the mind of man the virtue I have been
hitherto speaking of. In order to make us content with our present
condition, many of the present philosophers tell us, that our
discontent only hurts ourselves, without being able to make an
alteration in our circumstances; others, that whatever evil befals
us, is derived to us by a fatal necessity, to which the gods
themselves are subject; while others very gravely tell the man who
is miserable, that it is necessary he should be so to keep up the
harmony of the universe, and that the <i>scheme</i> of Providence
would be troubled and perverted were he otherwise.</p>
<p><b>17.</b> These, and the like considerations, rather silence
than satisfy a man. They may shew him that his discontent is
unreasonable; but are by no means sufficient to relieve it. They
rather give despair than consolation. In a word, a man might reply
to one of these comforters, as Augustus did to his friend who
advised him not to grieve for the death of a person whom he loved,
because his grief could not fetch him again: 'It is for that very
reason, said the emperor, that I grieve.'</p>
<p><b>18.</b> On the contrary, religion bears a more tender regard
to human nature. It prescribes to a very miserable man the means of
bettering his condition; nay, it shews him that the bearing of his
afflictions as he ought to do, will naturally end in the removal of
them: It makes him easy here, because it can make him happy
hereafter.</p>
<p><b>19.</b> Upon the whole, a contented mind is the greatest
blessing a man can enjoy in this world; and if in the present life
his happiness arises from the subduing his desires, it will arise
in the next from the gratification of them.</p>
<br>
<br>
<a name='Human_Miseries_chiefly_imaginary' id=
"Human_Miseries_chiefly_imaginary"></a>
<h2><i>Human Miseries chiefly imaginary.</i></h2>
<p><b>1.</b> It is a celebrated thought of <i>Socrates</i>, that if
all the misfortunes of mankind were cast into a public stock, in
order to be equally distributed among the whole species, those who
now think themselves the must unhappy, would prefer the share they
are already possessed of, before that which would fall to them by
such a division. <i>Horace</i> has carried this thought a great
deal further; who says, that the hardships or misfortunes we lie
under, are more easy to us than those of any other person would be,
in case we should change conditions with him.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> As I was ruminating-on these two remarks, and seated
in my elbow chair, I insensibly fell asleep; when, on a sudden,
methought there was a proclamation made by <i>Jupiter</i>, that,
every mortal should bring in his griefs and calamities, and throw
them together in a heap. There was a large plain appointed for this
purpose. I took my stand in the centre of it, and saw, with a great
deal of pleasure, the whole human species marching-one after
another, and throwing down their several loads, which immediately
grew up into a prodigious mountain that seemed to rise above the
clouds.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> There was a certain lady, of a thin airy shape, who
was very active in this solemnity. She carried a magnifying glass
in one of her hands, and was cloathed in a loose flowing robe,
embroidered with several figures of fiends and spectres, that
discovered themselves in a thousand chimerical shapes, as her
garments hovered in the wind; there was something wild, and
districted in her looks.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> Her name <i>Fancy</i>. She led up every mortal to the
appointed place, after having, very officiously assisted him in
making up his pack, and laying it upon his shoulders. My heart
melted within me to see my fellow-creatures groaning under their
respective burthens, and to consider that prodigious bulk of human
calamities which lay before me.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> There were, however, several persons who gave me great
diversion upon this occasion. I observed one bringing in a fardel
very carefully concealed under an old embroidered cloak, which,
upon his throwing it into the heap, I discovered to be poverty.
Another, after a great deal of puffing, threw down his luggage,
which, upon examining, I found to be his wife.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> There were multitudes of lovers saddled with very
whimsical burthens, composed of darts and flames; but what was very
odd, though they sighed as if their hearts would break under these
bundles of calamities, they could not persuade themselves to cast
them into the heap, when they came up to it; but, after a few faint
efforts, shook their heads and marched away, as heavy laden as they
came.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> I saw multitudes of old women throw down their
wrinkles, and several young ones who stripped themselves of a tawny
skin. There were very great heaps of red noses, large lips, and
rusty teeth. The truth of it is, I was surprised to see the
greatest part of the mountain made up of bodily deformities.
Observing one advancing towards the heap with a larger cargo than
ordinary upon his back, I found, upon his near approach, that it
was only a natural hump, which he disposed of with great joy of
heart, among this collection of human miseries.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> There were likewise distempers of all sorts, though I
could not but observe, that there were many more imaginary than
real. One little packet I could not but take notice of, which was a
complication of the diseases incident to human nature, and was in
the hands of a great many fine people: this was called the spleen.
But what most of all surprised me, was a remark I made, that there
was not a single vice or folly thrown into the whole heap; at which
I was very much astonished, having concluded within myself, that
every one would take this opportunity of getting rid of his
passions, prejudices and frailties.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> I took notice in particular of a very profligate
fellow, who, I did not question, came laden with his crimes, but,
upon searching into his bundle, I found, that instead of throwing
his guilt from him, he had only laid down his memory. He was
followed by another worthless rogue, who flung away his modesty
instead of his ignorance.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> When the whole race of mankind had thus cast their
burthens, the <i>phantom</i>, which had been so busy on this
occasion, seeing me an idle spectator of what passed, approached
towards me. I grew uneasy at her presence, when, on a sudden, she
laid her magnifying glass full before my eyes. I no sooner saw my
face in it but was startled at the shortness of it, which now
appeared to me in its utmost aggravation.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> The immoderate breadth of my features made me very
much out of humour with my own countenance, upon which I threw it
from me like a mask. It happened very luckily, that one who stood
by me had just before thrown down his visage, which, it satins, was
too long for him. It was, indeed, extended to a most shameful
length; I believe the very chin was, modestly speaking, as long as
my whole face.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> We had both of us an opportunity of mending
ourselves, and all the contributions being now brought in, every
man was at liberty to exchange his misfortune for those of another
person. But as there arose many new incidents in the sequel of my
vision, I shall pursue this subject further, as the moral which may
be drawn from it, is applicable to persons of all degrees and
stations in life.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> I gave my reader a sight of that mountain of
miseries, which was made up of those several calamities that
afflict the minds of men. I saw with unspeakable pleasure, the
whole species thus delivered from its sorrows; though, at the same
time, as we stood round the heap, and surveyed the several
materials of which it was composed, there was scarce a mortal, in
this vast multitude, who did not discover what he thought pleasures
and blessings of life; and wondered how the owners of them ever
came to look upon them as burthens and grievances.</p>
<p><b>14.</b> As we were regarding very attentively this confusion
of miseries, this chaos of calamity, <i>Jupiter</i> issued out a
second proclamation, that every one was now at liberty to exchange
his affliction, and to return to his habitation with any such other
bundle as should be delivered to him.</p>
<p><b>15.</b> Upon this, <i>Fancy</i> began again to bestir
herself, and parcelling out the whole heap, with incredible
activity, recommended to every one his particular packet. The hurry
and confusion at this time was not to be expressed. Some
observations which I made upon the occasion, I shall communicate to
the reader. A venerable grey-headed man, who had laid down his
cholic, and who, I found, wanted an heir to his estate, snatched up
an undutiful son, that had been thrown into the heap by his angry
father.</p>
<p><b>16.</b> The graceless youth, in less than a quarter of an
hour, pulled the old gentleman by the beard, and had like to have
knocked his brains out; so that meeting the true father, who came
toward him in a fit of the gripes, he begged him to take his son
again, and give him back his cholic; but they were incapable either
of them to recede from the choice they had made.</p>
<p><b>17.</b> A poor galley-slave, who had thrown down his chains,
took up the gout in their stead, but made such wry faces, that one
might easily perceive he was no great gainer by the bargain. It was
pleasant enough to see the several exchanges that were made, for
sickness against poverty, hunger against want of appetite, and care
against pain.</p>
<p><b>18.</b> The female world were very busy among themselves in
bartering for features; one was trucking a lock of grey hairs for a
carbuncle, another was making over a short waist for a pair of
round shoulders, and a third cheapening a bad face for a lost
reputation: but on all these occasions, there was not one of them
who did not think the new blemish, as soon as she had got it into
her possession, much more disagreeable than the old one.</p>
<p><b>19.</b> I made the same observation on every other misfortune
or calamity, which every one in the assembly brought upon himself,
in lieu of what he had parted with; whether it be that all the
evils which befall us, are in some measure suited and proportioned
to our strength, or that every evil becomes more supportable by our
being accustomed to it, I shall not determine.</p>
<p><b>20.</b> I could not, for my heart, forbear pitying the poor
hump-backed gentleman mentioned in the former paper, who went off a
very well-shaped person, with a stone in his bladder; nor the fine
gentleman who had struck up this bargain with him, that limped
through a whole assembly of ladies who used to admire him, with a
pair of shoulders peeping over his head.</p>
<p><b>21.</b> I must not omit my own particular adventure. My
friend with the long visage had no sooner taken upon him my short
face, but he made such a grotesque figure in it, that, as I looked
upon him, I could not forbear laughing at myself, insomuch that I
put my own face out of countenance. The poor gentleman was so
sensible of the ridicule, that I found he was ashamed of what he
had done: on the other side, I found that I myself had no great
reason to triumph, for as I went to touch my forehead, I missed the
place, and clapped my finger upon my upper lip.</p>
<p><b>22.</b> Besides, as my nose was exceedingly prominent, I gave
it two or three unlucky knocks as I was playing my hand about my
face, and aiming at some other part of it. I saw two other
gentlemen by me, who were in the same ridiculous circumstances:
these had made a foolish swap between a couple of thick bandy legs,
and two long trap-sticks that had no calfs to them.</p>
<p><b>23.</b> One of these looked like a man walking upon stilts,
and was so lifted up in the air above his ordinary height, that his
head turned round with It, while the other made such awkward
circles, as he attempted to walk, that he scarce knew how to move
forward upon his new supporters: observing him to be a pleasant
kind of fellow, I stuck my cane in the ground, and I told him I
would lay him a bottle of wine, that he did not march up to it on
the line that I drew for him, in a quarter of an hour.</p>
<p><b>24.</b> The heap was at last distributed among the two sexes,
who made a most piteous sight, as they wandered up and down under
the pressure of their several burthens. The whole plain was filled
with murmurs and complaints, groans and lamentations.
<i>Jupiter</i>, at length, taking compassion on the poor mortals,
ordered them a second time to lay down their loads, with a design
to give every one his own again.</p>
<p><b>25.</b> They discharged themselves with a great deal of
pleasure, alter which the phantom, who had led them into such gross
delusions, was commanded to disappear. There was sent in her stead
a goddess of a quite different figure; her motions were steady and
composed, and her aspect serious, but cheerful. She every now and
then cast her eyes towards heaven, and fixed them upon
<i>Jupiter</i>.</p>
<p><b>25.</b> Her name was <i>Patience</i>. She had no sooner
placed herself by the mount of sorrow, but, what I thought very
remarkable, the whole heap sunk to such a degree, that it did not
appear a third part so big as it was before. She afterwards
returned every man his own proper calamity, and teaching him how to
bear it in the most commodious manner, he marched off with it
contentedly, being very well pleased that he had not been left to
his own choice as to the kind of evils which fell to his lot.</p>
<p><b>27.</b> Besides the several pieces of morality to be drawn
out of this vision, I learned from it, never to repine at my own
misfortunes, nor to envy the happiness of another, since it is
impossible for any man to form a right judgment of his neighbour's
sufferings; for which reason also, I have determined never to think
too lightly of another's complaints, but to regard the sorrows of
my fellow-creatures with sentiments of humanity and compassion.</p>

<h2><i>A Life of Virtue preferable to a Life of Pleasure,
exemplified in the Choice of Hercules</i>.</h2>
<div style='text-align: right; margin-right: 10%;'>TATLER, No.
97.</div>
<p><b>1.</b> When Hercules, says the divine Prodicus, was in that
part of his youth, in which it was natural for him to consider what
course of life he ought to pursue, he one day retired into a
desert, where the silence and solitude of the place very much
favoured his meditations.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> As he was musing on his present condition, and very
much perplextd in himself on the state of life he should chuse, he
saw two women of a larger stature than ordinary approaching towards
him. One of them had a very noble air and graceful deportment; her
beauty was natural and easy; her person clean and unspotted; her
eyes cast towards the ground, with an agreeable reserve; her motion
and behaviour full of modesty; and her raiment as white as
snow.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> The other had a great deal of health and florridness
in her countenance, which she had helped with an artificial white
and red, and endeavoured to appear more graceful than ordinary in
her mein, by a mixture of affectation in all her gestures. She had
a wonderful confidence and assurance in her looks, and all the
variety of colours in her dress that she thought were the most
proper to shew her complexion to an advantage. She cast her eyes
upon herself, then turned them on those that were present to see
how they liked her, and often looked on the figure she made in her
own shadow.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> Upon her nearer approach to Hercules, she stepped
before the other lady, who came forward with a regular composed
carriage, and running up to him, accosted him after the following
manner:</p>
<p><b>5.</b> My dear Hercules, says she, I find you are very much
divided in your own thoughts upon the way of life that you ought to
chuse: be my friend and follow me; I will lead you into the
possession of pleasure and out of the reach of pain, and remove you
from all the noise and disquietude of business. The affairs of
either war or peace shall have no power to disturb you. Your whole
employment shall be to make your life easy, and to entertain every
sense with its proper gratifications. Sumptuous tables, beds of
roses, clouds of perfumes, concerts of music, crouds of beauties,
are all in readiness to receive you. Come along with me into this
region of delights, this world of pleasure, and bid farewell for
ever to care, to pain, and to business.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> Hercules hearing the lady talk after this manner,
desired to know her name; to which she answered, my friends, and
those who are well acquainted with me, call me Happiness; but my
enemies, and those who would injure my reputation, have given me
the name of Pleasure.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> By this time the other lady was come up, who addressed
herself to the young hero in a very different manner.</p>
<p>Hercules, says she, I offer myself to you, because I know you
are descended from the gods, and give proofs of that descent by
your love to virtue, and application to the studies proper to your
age. This makes me hope you will gain both for yourself and me an
immortal reputation. But before I invite you into my society and
friendship, I will be open and sincere with you, and must lay down
this as an established truth, that there is nothing truly valuable
which can be purchased without pains and labour.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> The gods have set a price upon every real and noble
pleasure. If you would gain the favour of the Deity, you must be at
the pains of worshipping him; if the friendship of good men, you
must study to oblige them; if you would be honoured by your
country, you must take care to serve it. In short, if you would be
eminent in war or peace, you must become master of all the
qualifications that can make you so. These are the only terms and
conditions upon which I can propose happiness. The goddess of
pleasure here broke in upon her discourse:</p>
<p><b>9.</b> You see, said she, Hercules, by her own confession,
the way to her pleasure is long and difficult, whereas that which I
propose is short and easy. Alas! said the other lady, whose visage
glowed with a passion made up of scorn and pity, what are the
pleasures you propose? To eat before you are hungry, drink before
you are thirsty, sleep before you are tired, to gratify appetites
before they are raised, and raise such appetites as nature never
planted.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> You never heard the most delicate music, which is the
praise of one's self; nor saw the most beautiful object, which is
the work of one's own hands. Your votaries pass away their youth in
a dream of mistaken pleasures, while they are hoarding up anguish,
torment, and remorse, for old age.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> As for me, I am a friend of the Gods and of good men,
an agreeable companion to the artisan, a household guardian to the
fathers of families, a patron and protector of servants, and
associate in all true and generous friendships. The banquets of my
votaries are never costly, but always delicious; for none eat or
drink at them who are not invited by hunger and thirst. Their
slumbers are sound, and their wakings cheerful.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> My young men have the pleasure of hearing themselves
praised by those who are in years, and those who are in years, of
being honoured by those who are young. In a word, my followers are
favoured by the gods, beloved by their acquaintance, esteemed by
their country, and after the close of their labours, honoured by
posterity.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> We know by the life of this memorable hero, to which
of these two ladies he gave up his heart; and I believe, every one
who reads this, will do him the justice to approve his choice.</p>
<p><b>14.</b> I very much admire the speeches of these ladies, as
containing in them the chief arguments for a life of virtue, or a
life of pleasure, that could enter into the thoughts of an heathen:
but am particularly pleased with the different figures he gives the
two goddesses. Our modern authors have represented pleasure or vice
with an alluring face, but ending in snakes and monsters: here she
appears in all the charms of beauty, though they are all false and
borrowed; and by that means compose a vision entirely natural and
pleasing.</p>
<p><b>15.</b> I have translated this allegory for the benefit of
the youth in general; and particularly of those who are still in
the deplorable state of non-existence, and whom I most earnestly
intreat to come into the world. Let my embryos shew the least
inclination to any single virtue, and I shall allow it to be a
struggling towards birth.</p>
<p><b>16.</b> I do not expect of them that, like the hero in the
foregoing story, they should go about as soon as they are born,
with a club in their hands, and a lion's skin on their shoulders,
to root out monsters and destroy tyrants; but as the finest author
of all antiquity has said upon this very occasion, though a man has
not the abilities to distinguish himself in the most shining parts
of a great character, he has certainly the capacity of being just,
faithful, modest, and temperate.</p>

<h2><i>Virtue rewarded; The History of Amanda</i>.</h2>
<div style='text-align: right; margin-right: 10%;'>SPECTATOR, No.
375.</div>
<p><b>1.</b> I have more than once had occasion to mention a noble
saying of Seneca the philosopher, that a virtuous person struggling
with misfortunes, and rising above them, is an object on which the
gods themselves may look down with delight. I shall therefore set
before my readers a scene of this kind of distress in private life,
for the speculation of this day.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> An eminent citizen, who had lived in good fashion and
credit, was by a train of accidents, and by an unavoidable
perplexity in his affairs, reduced to a low condition. There is a
modesty usually attending faultless poverty, which made him rather
chuse to reduce his manner of living to his present circumstances,
than solicit his friends, in order to support the shew of an
estate, when the substance was gone.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> His wife, who was a woman of sense and virtue, behaved
herself on this occasion with uncommon decency, and never appeared
so amiable in his eyes as now. Instead of upbraiding him with the
ample fortune she had brought, or the many great offers she had
refused for his sake, she redoubled all the instances of her
affection, while her husband was continually pouring out his heart
to her in complaints, that he had ruined the best woman in the we
world.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> He sometimes came home at a time when she did not
expect him, and surprised her in tears, which she endeavoured to
conceal, and always put on an air of cheerfulness to receive him.
To lessen their expense, their eldest daughter (whom I shall call
Amanda) was sent into the country, to the house of an honest
farmer, who had married a servant of the family: This young woman
was apprehensive of the ruin which was approaching, and had
privately engaged a friend in the neighbourhood to give her an
account of what passed from time to time in her father's
affairs.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> Amanda was in the bloom of her youth and beauty, when
the lord of the manor, who often called in at the farmer's house as
he followed his country sports, fell passionately in love with her.
He was a man of great generosity, but from a loose education had
contracted a hearty aversion to marriage. He therefore entertained
a design upon Amanda's virtue, which at present he thought fit to
keep private. The innocent creature, who never suspected his
intentions, was pleased with his person; and, having observed his
growing passion for her, hoped by so advantageous a match she might
quickly be in a capacity of supporting her impoverished
relations.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> One day as he called to see her, he found her in tears
over a letter she had just received from her friend, which gave an
account that her father had been lately stript of every thing by an
execution. The lover, who with some difficulty found out the cause
of her grief, took this occasion to make her a proposal. It is
impossible to express Amanda's confusion when she found his
pretentions were not honourable.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> She was now deserted of all hopes, and had no power to
speak; but rushing from him in the utmost disturbance, locked
herself up in her chamber. He immediately dispatched a messenger to
her father with the following letter.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> SIR,</p>
<p>'I have heard of your misfortune, and have offered your
daughter, if she will live with me, to settle on her four hundred
pounds a year, and to lay down the sum for which you are now
distressed. I will be so ingenuous as to tell you, that I do not
intend marriage; but if you are wise, you will use your authority
with her not to be too nice, when she has an opportunity of serving
you and your family, and of making herself happy.</p>
<div style='text-align: right; margin-right: 10%;'>'<i>I am</i>,
&amp;c.'</div>
<p><b>9.</b> This letter came to the hands of Amanda's mother: she
opened and read it with great surprise and concern. She did not
think it proper to explain herself to the messenger; but desiring
him to call again the next morning, she wrote to her daughter as
follows:</p>
<p><b>10.</b> <i>Dearest Child</i>,</p>
<p>'Your father and I have just now received a letter from a
gentleman who pretends love to you, with a proposal that insults
our misfortunes, and would throw us to a lower degree of misery
than any thing which is come upon us. How could this barbarous man
think that the tenderest of parents would be tempted to supply
their wants, by giving up the best of children to infamy and ruin!
It is a mean and cruel artifice to make this proposal at a time
when he thinks our necessities must compel us to any thing; but we
will not eat the bread of shame; and therefore we charge thee not
to think of us, but to avoid the snare which is laid for thy
virtue. Beware of pitying us: it is not so bad as you have perhaps
been told. All things will yet be well, and I shall write my child
better news.</p>
<p>'I have been interrupted. I know not how I was moved to say
things would mend. As I was going on, I was startled by the noise
of one that knocked at the door, and had brought us an unexpected
supply of a debt which had long been owing. Oh! I will now tell
thee all. It is some days I have lived almost without support,
having conveyed what little money I could raise to your poor
father. Thou wilt weep to think where he is, yet be assured he will
soon be at liberty. That cruel letter would have broke his heart,
but I have concealed it from him. I have no companion at present
besides little Fanny, who stands watching my looks as I write, and
is crying for her sister; she says she is sure you are not well,
having discovered that my present trouble is about you. But do not
think I would thus repeat my sorrows to grieve thee. No, it is to
intreat thee not to make them insupportable, by adding what would
be worse than all. Let us bear cheerfully an affliction which we
have not brought on ourselves, and remember there is a Power who
can better deliver us out of it, than by the loss of thy innocence.
Heaven preserve my dear child.</p>
<div style='text-align: right; margin-right: 10%;'>'<i>Thy
affectionate mother</i>&mdash;.'</div>
<p><b>11.</b> The messenger, notwithstanding he promised to deliver
this letter to Amanda, carried it first to his master, who, he
imagined, would be glad to have an opportunity of giving it into
her hands himself. His master was impatient to know the success of
his proposal, and therefore broke open the letter privately, to see
the contents.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> He was not a little moved at so true a picture of
virtue in distress: but, at the same time, was infinitely surprised
to find his offers rejected. However, he resolved not to suppress
the letter, but carefully sealed it up again, and carried it to
Amanda. All his endeavours to see her were in vain, till she was
assured he brought a letter from her mother. He would not part with
it but upon condition that she should read it without leaving the
room.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> While she was perusing it, he fixed his eyes on her
face with the deepest attention; her concern gave a new softness to
her beauty, and when she burst into tears, he could no longer
refrain from bearing a part in her sorrow, and telling her, that he
too had read the letter, and was resolved to make reparation for
having been the occasion of it. My reader will not be displeased to
see the second epistle which he now wrote to Amanda's mother.</p>
<p>MADAM,</p>
<p>'I am full of shame, and will never forgive myself if I have not
your pardon for what I lately wrote. It was far from my intention
to add trouble to the afflicted; nor could any thing but my being a
stranger to you, have betrayed me into a fault, for which, if I
live, I shall endeavour to make you amends as a son. You cannot be
unhappy while Amanda is your daughter: nor shall be, if any thing
can prevent it, which is in the power of,</p>
<div style='text-align: right; margin-right: 10%;'>MADAM,<br>
<br>
<i>Your obedient humble servant</i>&mdash;.'</div>
<p><b>14.</b> This letter he sent by his steward, and soon after
went up to town himself to complete the generous act he had now
resolved on. By his friendship and assistance, Amanda's father was
quickly in a condition of retrieving his perplexed affairs. To
conclude, he married Amanda, and enjoyed the double satisfaction of
having restored a worthy family to their former prosperity, and of
making himself happy by an alliance to their virtues.</p>

<h2><i>The Story of Abdallah and Balsora.</i></h2>
<div style='text-align: right; margin-right: 10%;'>GUARDIAN, No.
167.</div>
<p><b>1.</b> The following story is lately translated out of an
Arabian manuscript, which I think has very much the turn of an
oriental tale: and as it has never before been printed, I question
not but it will be highly acceptable to my reader.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> The name of Helim is still famous through all the
eastern parts of the world. He is called among the Persians, even
to this day, Helim the great physician. He was acquainted with all
the powers of simples, understood all the influence of the stars,
and knew the secrets that were engraved on the seal of Solomon the
son of David. Helim was also governor of the black palace, and
chief of the physicians to Alnareschin the great king of
Persia.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> Alnareschin was the most dreadful tyrant that ever
reigned in this country. He was of a fearful, suspicious and cruel
nature, having put to death, upon very slight jealousies; and
surmises, five-and-thirty of his queens, and above twenty sons whom
he suspected to have conspired against his life. Being at length
wearied with the exercise of so many cruelties in his own family,
and fearing lest the whole race of Caliphs should be entirely lost,
he one day sent for Helim, and spoke to him after this manner.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> 'Helim,' said he, 'I have long admired thy great
wisdom, and retired way of living. I shall now shew thee the entire
confidence which I place in thee. I have only two sons remaining,
who are as yet but infants. It is my design that thou take them
home with thee, and educate them as thy own. Train them up in the
humble unambitious pursuits of knowledge. By this means shall the
line of Caliphs be preserved, and my children succeed after me,
without aspiring to my throne whilst I am yet alive.'</p>
<p><b>5.</b> The words of my lord the king shall be obeyed, said
Helim. After which he bowed, and went out of the king's presence.
He then received the children into his own house, and from that
time bred them up with him in the studies of knowledge and virtue.
The young princes loved and respected Helim as their father, and
made such improvements under him, that by the age of one-and-twenty
they were instructed in all the learning of the East.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> The name of the eldest was Ibrahim, and of the
youngest Abdallah. They lived together in such a perfect
friendship, that to this day it is said of intimate friends, that
they live together like Ibrahim and Abdallah. Helim had an only
child, who was a girl of a fine soul, and a most beautiful person.
Her father omitted nothing in her education, that might make her
the most accomplished woman of her age.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> As the young princes were in a manner excluded from
the rest of the world, they frequently conversed with this lovely
virgin, who had been brought up by her father in the same course of
knowledge and of virtue.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> Abdallah, whose mind was of a softer turn than tint of
his brother, grew by degrees so enamoured of her conversation, that
he did not think he lived, when he was not in company with his
beloved Balsora, for that was the name of the maid. The fame of her
beauty was so great, that at length it came to the ears of the
king, who, pretending to visit the young princes his sons, demanded
of Helim the sight of Balsora his fair daughter.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> The king was so enflamed with her beauty and
behaviour, that he sent for Helim the next morning, and told him it
was now his design to recompence him for all his faithful services;
and that in order to it, he intended to make his daughter queen of
Persia.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> Helim, who knew very well the fate of all those
unhappy women who had been thus advanced, and could not but be
privy to the secret love which Abdallah bore his daughter; 'Far be
it,' says he, 'from the king of Persia to contaminate the blood of
the Caliphs, and join himself in marriage with the daughter of his
physcian.'</p>
<p><b>11.</b> The king, however, was so impatient for such a bride,
that without hearing any excuses, he immediately ordered Balsora to
be sent for into his presence, keeping the father with him in order
to make her sensible of the honour which he designed. Balsora, who
was too modest and humble to think her beauty had made such an
impression on the king, was a few moments after brought into his
presence as he had commanded.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> She appeared in the king's eye as one of the virgins
of paradise. But upon hearing the honour which he intended her, she
fainted away, and fell down as dead at his feet. Helim wept, and
after having recovered her out of the trance into which she was
fallen, represented to the king that so unexpected an honour was
too great to have been communicated to her all at once; but that,
if he pleased, he would himself prepare her for it. The king bid
him take his own away and dismissed him.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> Balsora was conveyed again to her father's house,
where the thoughts of Abdallah renewed her affliction every moment;
insomuch that at length she fell into a raging fever. The king was
informed of her condition by those who saw her. Helim finding no
other means of extricating her from the difficulties she was in,
after having composed her mind, and made her acquainted with his
intentions, gave her a certain potion, which he knew would lay her
asleep for many hours; and afterwards in all the seeming distress
of a disconsolate father informed the king she was dead.</p>
<p><b>14.</b> The king, who never let any sentiments of humanity
come too near his heart, did not much trouble himself about the
matter; however, for his own reputation, he told the father, that
since it was known through the empire that Balsora died at a time
when he designed her for his bride, it was his intention that she
should be honoured as such after her death, that her body should be
laid in the black palace, among those of his deceased queens.</p>
<p><b>15.</b> In the meantime Abdallah, who had heard of the king's
design, was not less afflicted than his beloved Balsora. As for the
several circumstances of his distress, as also how the king was
informed of an irrecoverable distemper into which he was fallen,
they are to be found at length in the history of Helim.</p>
<p><b>16.</b> It shall suffice to acquaint the reader, that Helim,
some days after the supposed death of his daughter, gave the prince
a potion of the same nature with which he had laid asleep
Balsora.</p>
<p><b>17.</b> It is the custom among the Persians, to convey in a
private manner the bodies of all the royal family a little after
their death, into the black palace; which is the repository of all
who are descended from the Caliphs, or any way allied to them. The
chief physician is always governor of the black palace; it being
his office to embalm and preserve the holy family after they are
dead, as well as to take care of them while they are yet
living.</p>
<p><b>18.</b> The black palace is so called from the colour of the
building, which is all of the finest polished black marble. There
are always burning in it five thousand everlasting lamps. It has
also an hundred folding doors of ebony, which are each of them
watched day and night by an hundred negroes, who are to take care
that nobody enters besides the governor.</p>
<p><b>19.</b> Helim, after having conveyed the body of his daughter
into this repository, and at the appointed time received her out of
the sleep into which she was fallen, took care some time after to
bring that of Abdallah into the same place. Balsora, watched over
him till such time as the dose he had taken lost its effect.
Abdallah was not acquainted with Helim's design when he gave him
this sleepy potion.</p>
<p><b>20.</b> It is impossible to describe the surprise, the joy,
the transport he was in at his first awaking. He fancied himself in
the retirement of the blest, and that the spirit of his dear
Balsora, who he thought was just gone before him, was the first who
came to congratulate his arrival. She soon informed him of the
place he was in, which notwithstanding all its horrors, appeared to
him more sweet than the bower of Mahomet, in the company of his
Balsora.</p>
<p><b>21.</b> Helim, who was supposed to be taken up in the
embalming of the bodies, visited the place very frequently. His
greatest perplexity was how to get the lovers out of it, the gates
being watched in such a manner as I have before related. This
consideration did not a little disturb the two interred lovers.</p>
<p><b>22.</b> At length Helim bethought himself, that the first day
of the full moon of the month Tizpa was near at hand. Now it is a
received tradition among the Persians, that the souls of those of
the royal family, who are in a state of bliss, do, on the first
full moon after their decease, pass through the eastern gate of the
black palace, which is therefore called the Gate of Paradise, in
order to take their flight for that happy place.</p>
<p><b>23.</b> Helim, therefore, having made due preparation for
this night, dressed each of the lovers in a robe of azure silk,
wrought in the finest looms of Persia, with a long train of linen
whiter than snow, that flowed on the ground behind them. Upon
Abdallah's head he fixed a wreath of the greenest myrtle, and on
Balsora's a garland of the freshest roses. Their garments were
scented with the richest perfumes of Arabia.</p>
<p><b>24.</b> Having thus prepared every thing, the full moon was
no sooner up, and shining in all its brightness, but he privately
opened the Gate of Paradise, and shut it after the same manner, as
soon as they had passed through it.</p>
<p><b>25.</b> The band of negroes who were posted at a little
distance from the gate, seeing two such beautiful apparitions, that
shewed themselves to'aclvantage by the light of the full moon, and
being ravished with the odour that flowed from their garments,
immediately concluded them to be the ghosts of the two persons
lately deceased.</p>
<p><b>26.</b> They fell upon their faces as they passed through the
midst of them, and continued prostrate on the earth until such time
as they were out of sight. They reported the next day what they had
seen, but this was looked upon by the king himself and most others,
as the compliment that was usually paid to any of the deceased of
his family.</p>
<p><b>27.</b> Helim had placed two of his own mules about a mile's
distance from the black temple, on the spot which they had agreed
upon for their rendezvous. Here he met them, and conducted them to
one of his own houses, which was situated on mount
<i>Khacan</i>.</p>
<p><b>28.</b> The air of this mountain was so very healthful, that
Helim had formerly transported the king thither, in order to
recover him out of a long fit of sickness, which succeeded so well,
that the king made him a present of the whole mountain, with a
beautiful house and garden that were on the top of it.</p>
<p><b>29.</b> In this retirement lived Abdallah and Balsora. They
were both so fraught with all kinds of knowledge, and possessed
with so constant and mutual a passion for each other, that their
solitude never lay heavy on them.</p>
<p><b>30.</b> Abdallah applied himself to those arts Which were
agreeable to his manner of living, and the situation of the place;
insomuch that in a few years he converted the whole mountain into a
kind of garden, and covered every part of it with plantations or
spots of flowers.</p>
<p>Helim was too good a father to let him want any thing that might
conduce to make his retirement pleasant.</p>
<p><b>31.</b> In about ten years after their abode in this place,
the old king died, and was succeeded by his son Ibrahim, who upon
the supposed death of his brother, had been called to court, and
entertained there as heir to the Persian empire. Though he was some
years inconsolable for the death of his brother, Helim durst not
trust him with the secret, which he knew would have fatal
consequences, should it by any means come to the knowledge of the
old king.</p>
<p><b>32.</b> Ibrahim was no sooner mounted to the throne, but
Helim sought after a proper opportunity of making a discovery to
him, which he knew would be very agreeable to so good natured and
generous a prince. It so happened, that before Helim found such an
opportunity as he desired, the new king Ibrahim, having been
separated from his company in a chase, and almost fainting with
heat and thirst, saw himself at the foot of mount Khacan. He
immediately ascended the hill, and coming to Helim's house,
demanded some refreshments.</p>
<p><b>33.</b> Helim was very luckily there at that time; and after
having set before the king the choicest of wines and fruits,
finding him wonderfully pleased with so seasonable a treat, told
him that the best part of his entertainment was to come. Upon which
he opened to him the whole history of what had passed. The king was
at once astonished and transported at so strange a relation, and
seeing his brother enter the room with Balsora in his hand, he
leaped off from the sofa on which he sat, and cried out, 'It is he!
it is my Abdallah!' Having said this, he fell upon his neck, and
wept.</p>
<p><b>34.</b> The whole company for some time remained silent, and
shedding tears of joy. The king at length having kindly reproached
Helim for depriving him so long from such a brother, embraced
Balsora with the greatest tenderness, and told her that she should
now be a queen indeed, for that he would immediately make his
brother king of all the conquered nations on the other side the
Tigris.</p>
<p><b>35.</b> He easily discovered in the eyes of our two lovers,
that instead of being transported with the offer, they preferred
their present retirement to empire. At their request, therefore, he
changed his intentions, and made them a present of all the open
country as far as they could sec from the top of mount Khacan.</p>
<p><b>36.</b> Abdallah continuing to extend his former
improvements, beautified this whole prospect with groves and
fountains, gardens and seats of pleasure, until it became the most
delicious spot of ground within the empire, and is therefore called
the garden of Persia.</p>
<p><b>37.</b> This Caliph, Ibrahim, after a long and happy reign,
died without children, and was succeeded by Abdallah, a son of
Abdallah and Balsora. This was that king Abdallah, who afterwards
fixed the imperial residence upon mount Khacan, which continues at
this time to be the favourite palace of the Persian empire.</p>

"On_Rashness_and_Cowardice"></a>
<h2><i>On Rashness and Cowardice.</i></h2>
<div style='text-align: right; margin-right: 10%;'>RAMBLER, No.
25.</div>
<p><b>1.</b> There are some vices and errors which, though often
fatal to those in whom they are found, have yet, by the universal
consent of mankind, been considered as entitled to some degree of
respect, or have at least been exempted from contemptuous infamy,
and condemned by the severest moralists with pity rather than
detestation.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> A constant and invariable example of this general
partiality will be found in the different regard which has always
been shewn to rashness and cowardice; two vices, of which, though
they maybe conceived equally distant from the middle point, where
true fortitude is placed, and may equally injure any public or
private interest, yet the one is never mentioned without some kind
of veneration, and the other always considered as a topic of
unlimited and licentious censure, on which all the virulence of
reproach may he lawfully exerted.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> The same distinction is made, by the common suffrage,
between profusion and avarice, and perhaps between many other
opposite vices; and, as I have found reason to pay great regard to
the voice of the people, in cases where knowledge has been forced
upon them by experience, without long deductions or deep
researches, I am inclined to believe that this distribution of
respect is not without some agreement with the nature of things;
and that in the faults, which are thus invested with extraordinary
privileges, there are generally some latent principles of merit,
some possibilities of future virtue, which may, by decrees, break
from obstruction, and by time and opportunity be brought into
act.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> It may be laid down as an axiom, that it is more easy
to take away superfluities than to supply defects; and therefore,
he that is culpable, because he has passed the middle point of
virtue, is always accounted a fairer object of hope, than he who
fails by falling short. The one has all that perfection requires,
and more, but the excess may be easily retrenched; the other wants
the qualities requisite to excellence, and who can tell how he
shall obtain them?</p>
<p><b>5.</b> We are certain that the horse may be taught to keep
pace with his fellows, whose fault it is that he leaves them
behind. We know that a few strokes of the axe will lop a cedar; but
what arts of cultivation can elevate a shrub?</p>
<p><b>6.</b> To walk with circumspection and steadiness in the
right path, at an equal distance between the extremes of error,
ought to be the constant endeavour of every reasonable being; nor
can I think those teachers of moral wisdom much to be honoured as
benefactors to mankind, who are always enlarging upon the
difficulty of our duties, and providing rather excuses for vice,
than incentives to virtue.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> But, since to most it will happen often, and to all
sometimes, that there will be a deviation towards one side or the
other, we ought always to employ our vigilance with most attention,
on that enemy from which there is the greatest danger, and to
stray, if we must stray, towards those parts from whence we may
quickly and easily return.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> Among other opposite qualities of the mind, which may
become dangerous, though in different degrees, I have often had
occasion to consider the contrary effects of presumption and
despondency; of steady confidence, which promises a victory without
contest, and heartless pusilanimity, which shrinks back from the
thought of great undertakings, confounds difficulty with
impossibility, and considers all advancement towards any new
attainment, as irreversibly prohibited.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> Presumption will be easily corrected. Every experiment
will teach caution, and miscarriages will hourly shew, that
attempts are not always rewarded with success. The most precipitate
ardour will, in time, be taught the necessity of methodical
gradation, and preparatory measures; and the most daring confidence
be convinced, that neither merit nor abilities can command
events.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> It is the advantage of vehemence and activity, that
they are always hastening to their own reformation; because they
incite us to try whether our expectations are well grounded; and
therefore detect the deceits which they are apt to occasion. But
timidity is a disease of the mind more obstinate and fatal; for a
man once persuaded, that any impediment is insuperable, has given
it, with respect to himself, that strength and weight which it had
not before.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> He can scarcely strive with vigour and perseverance,
when he has no hope of gaining the victory; and since he will never
try his strength, can never discover the unreasonableness of his
fears.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> There is often to be found in men devoted to
literature, a kind of intellectual cowardice, which whoever
converses much among them, may observe frequently to depress the
alacrity of enterprise, and by consequence to retard the
improvement of science.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> They have annexed to every species of knowledge, some
chimerical character of terror and inhibition, which they transmit,
without much reflection, from one to another; they first fright
themselves, and then propagate the panic to their scholars and
acquaintances.</p>
<p><b>14.</b> One study is inconsistent with a lively imagination,
another with a solid judgment; one is improper in the early parts
of life, another requires so much time, that it is not to be
attempted at an advanced age; one is dry and contracts the
sentiments, another is diffuse and over-burdens the memory; one is
insufferable to taste and delicacy, and another wears out life in
the study of words, and is useless to a wise man, who desires only
the knowledge of things.</p>
<p><b>15.</b> But of all the bugbears by which the <i>infantes
barbati</i>, boys both young and old, have been hitherto frighted
from digressing into new tracts of learning, none has been more
mischievously efficacious than an opinion that every kind of
knowledge requires a peculiar genius, or mental constitution,
framed for the reception of some ideas and the exclusion of others;
and that to him whose genius is not adapted to the study which he
prosecutes, all labour shall be vain and fruitless; vain as an
endeavour to mingle oil and water, or, in the language of
chemistry, to amalgamate bodies of heterogeneous principles.</p>
<p><b>16.</b> This opinion we may reasonably suspect to have been
propogated, by vanity, beyond the truth. It is natural for those
who have raised a reputation by any science, to exalt themselves as
endowed by heaven with peculiar powers, or marked out by an
extraordinary designation for their profession: and to fright
competitors away by representing the difficulties with which they
must contend, and the necessity of qualities which are supposed to
be not generally conferred, and which no man can know, but by
experience, whether he enjoys.</p>
<p><b>17.</b> To this discouragement it may possibly be answered,
that since a genius, whatever it may be, is like fire in the flint,
only to be produced by collision with a proper subject, it is the
business of every man to try whether his faculties may not happily
co-operate with his desires; and since they whose proficiency he
admires, knew their own force only by the event, he needs but
engage in the same undertaking, with equal spirit, and may
reasonably hope for equal success.</p>
<p><b>18.</b> There is another species of false intelligence, given
by those who profess to shew the way to the summit of knowledge, of
equal tendency to depress the mind with false distrust of itself,
and weaken it by needless solicitude and dejection. When a scholar
whom they desire to animate, consults them at his entrance on some
new study, it is common to make flattering representations of its
pleasantness and facility.</p>
<p><b>19.</b> Thus they generally attain one of the two ends almost
equally desirable; they either incite his industry by elevating his
hopes, or produce a high opinion of their own abilities, since they
are supposed to relate only what they have found, and to have
proceeded with no less ease than they have promised to their
followers.</p>
<p><b>20.</b> The student, enflamed by this encouragement, sets
forward in the new path, and proceeds a few steps with great
alacrity; but he soon finds asperities and intricacies of which he
has not been forewarned, and imagining that none ever were so
entangled or fatigued before him, sinks suddenly into despair, and
desists as from an expedition in which fate opposes him. Thus his
terrors are multiplied by his hopes, and he is defeated without
resistance, because he had no expectation of an enemy.</p>
<p><b>21.</b> Of these treacherous instructors, the one destroys
industry, by declaring that industry is vain, the other by
representing it as needless: the one cuts away the root of hope,
the other raises it only to be blasted. The one confines his pupil
to the shore, by telling him that his wreck is certain; the other
sends him to sea without preparing him for tempests.</p>
<p><b>22.</b> False hopes and false terrors, are equally to be
avoided. Every man who proposes to grow eminent by learning, should
carry in his mind, at once, the difficulty of excellence, and the
force of industry; and remember that fame is not conferred but as
the recommence of labour, and that labour, vigorously continued,
has not often failed of its reward.</p>

<p><b>1.</b> Looking over the late edition of Monsieur
<i>Boileau's</i> works, I was very much pleased with the article
which he has added to his notes on the translation of
<i>Longinus</i>. He there tells us, that the sublime in writing
rises either from the nobleness of the thought, the magnificence of
the words, or the harmonious and lively turn of the phrase, and
that the perfect sublime rises from all these three in conjunction
together. He produces an instance of this perfect sublime in four
verses from the Athalia of Monsieur <i>Racine</i>.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> When <i>Abner</i>, one of the chief officers of the
court, represents to <i>Joad</i> the high priest, that the queen
was incensed against him, the high priest, not in the least
terrified at the news, returns this answer:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'><span><i>Celui que met un frein &agrave; la
fureur des flots,</i><br></span> <span><i>Scait aussi des
m&eacute;chans arr&eacute;ter les complots;</i><br></span>
<span><i>Soumis avecs respect &agrave; sa volutt&eacute;
sainte,</i><br></span> <span><i>Je crains Dieu, cher Abner, &amp;
n'ai point d'autre crainte.</i><br></span></div>
</div>
<p><b>3.</b> 'He who ruleth the raging of the sea, knows also how
to check the designs of the ungodly. I submit myself with reverence
to his holy will. O Abner! I fear my God, and I fear none but him.'
Such a thought gives no less a solemnity to human nature, than it
does to good writing.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> This religious fear, when it is produced by just
apprehensions of a divine power, naturally overlooks all human
greatness that stands in competition with it, and extinguishes
every other terror that can settle itself in the heart of a man: it
lessens and contracts the figure of the most exalted person: it
disarms the tyrant and executioner, and represents to our minds the
most enraged and the most powerful as altogether harmless and
impotent.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> There is no true fortitude which is not founded upon
this fear, as there is no other principle of so settled and fixed a
nature. Courage that grows from constitution, very often forsakes a
man when he has occasion for it; and when it is only a kind of
instinct in the soul, breaks out on all occasions without judgment
or discretion. That courage which proceeds from a sense of our
duty, and from a fear of offending him that made us, acts always in
an uniform manner, and according to the dictates of right
reason.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> What can a man fear who takes care in all his actions
to please a Being that is omnipotent; a Being who is able to crush
all his adversaries; a Being that can divert any misfortune from
befalling him, or turn any such misfortune to his advantage? The
person who lives with this constant and habitual regard to the
great superintendant of the world, is indeed sure that no real evil
can come into his lot.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> Blessings may appear under the shape of pains, losses
and disappointments, but let him have patience, and he will see
them in their proper figures. Dangers may threaten him, but he may
rest satisfied that they will either not reach him, or that if they
do, they will be the instruments of good to him. In short, he may
lock upon all crosses and accidents, sufferings and afflictions, as
means which are made use of to bring him to happiness.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> This is even the worst of that man's condition whose
mind is possessed with the habitual fear of which I am now
speaking. But it very often happens, that those which appear evils
in our own eyes, appear also as such to him who has human nature
under his care, in which case they are certainly averted from the
person who has made himself, by this virtue, an object of divine
favour.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> Histories are full of instances of this nature, where
men of virtue have had extraordinary escapes out of such dangers as
have enclosed them, and which have seemed inevitable.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> There is no example of this kind in Pagan history
which more pleases me than that which is recorded in the life of
<i>Timoleon</i>. This extraordinary man was famous for referring
all his successes to Providence. <i>Cornelius Nepos</i> acquaints
us that he had in his house a private chapel in which he used to
pay his devotions to the goddess who represented Providence among
the heathens. I think no man was ever more distinguished by the
Deity, whom he blindly worshipped, than the great person I am
speaking of, in several occurrences of his life, but particularly
in the following one, which I shall relate out of
<i>Plutarch</i>.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> Three persons had entered into a conspiracy to
assassinate <i>Timoleon</i> as he was offering up his devotions in
a certain temple. In order to it they took their several stands in
the most convenient places for their purpose. As they were waiting
for an opportunity to put their design in execution, a stranger
having observed one of the conspirators, fell upon him and slew
him. Upon which the other two, thinking their plot had been
discovered, threw themselves at <i>Timoleon's</i> feet, and
confessed the whole matter.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> This stranger, upon examination, was found to have
understood nothing of the intended assassination, but having
several years before had a brother killed by the conspirator, whom
he here put to death, and having till now sought in vain for an
opportunity of revenge, he chanced to meet the murderer in the
temple, who had planted himself there for the above-mentioned
purpose.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> <i>Plutarch</i> cannot forbear on this occasion,
speaking with a kind of rapture on the schemes of Providence,
which, in this particular, had so contrived it that the stranger
should, for so great a space of time, be debarred the means of
doing justice to his brother, till by the same blow that revenged
the death of one innocent man, he preserved the life of
another.</p>
<p><b>14.</b> For my own part, I cannot wonder that a man of
<i>Timoleon's</i> religion should have this intrepidity and
firmness of mind, or that he should be distinguished by such a
deliverance as I have here related.</p>

26.</div>
<p><b>1.</b> It is usual for men, engaged in the same pursuits, to
be inquisitive after the conduct and fortune of each other; and
therefore, I suppose it will not be unpleasing to you to read an
account of the various changes which have appeared in part of a
life devoted to literature. My narrative will not exhibit any great
variety of events, or extraordinary revolutions; but may perhaps be
not less useful, because I shall relate nothing which is not likely
to happen to a thousand others.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> I was born heir to a very small fortune, and left by
my father, whom I cannot remember, to the care of an uncle. He
having no children, always treated me as his son, and finding in me
those qualities which old men easily discover in sprightly children
when they happen to love them, declared that a genius like mine
should never be lost for want of cultivation.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> He therefore placed me for the usual time at a great
school, and then sent me to the university, with a larger allowance
than my own patrimony would have afforded, that I might not keep
mean company, but learn to become my dignity when I should be made
Lord Chancellor, which he often lamented that the increase of his
infirmities was very likely to preclude him from seeing.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> This exuberance of money displayed itself in gaiety of
appearance, and wantonness of expence, and introduced me to the
acquaintance of those whom the same superfluity of fortune had
betrayed to the same licence and ostentation: young heirs who
pleased themselves with a remark very frequently in their mouths,
that though they were sent by their fathers to the university, they
were not under the necessity of living by their learning.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> Among men of this class I easily obtained the
reputation of a great genius, and was persuaded that, with such
liveliness of imagination, and delicacy of sentiment, I should
never be able to submit to the drudgery of the law.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> I therefore gave myself wholly to the more airy and
elegant parts of learning, and was often so much elated with my
superiority to the youths with whom I conversed, that I began to
listen with great attention, to those who recommended to me a wider
and more conspicuous theatre; and was particularly touched with an
observation made by one of my friends, that it was not by lingering
in the university that Prior became ambassador, or Addison a
secretary of state.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> This desire was hourly increased by the solicitation
of my companions, who removing one by one to London, as the caprice
of their relations allowed them, or the legal dismission from the
hands of their guardian put it in their power, never failed to send
an account of the beauty and felicity of the new world, and to
remonstrate how much was lost by every hour's continuance in a
place of retirement and restraint.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> My uncle, in the mean time, frequently harrassed me
with monitory letters, which I sometimes neglected to open for a
week after I received them, and generally read in a tavern, with
such comments as I might show how much I was superior to
instruction or advice. I could not but wonder, how a man confined
to the country and unacquainted with the present system of things,
should imagine himself qualified to instruct a rising genius, born
to give laws to the age, refine its state, and multiply its
pleasures.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> The postman, however, still continued to bring me new
remonstrances; for my uncle was very little depressed by the
ridicule and reproach which he never heard. But men of parts have
quick resentments; it was impossible to bear his usurpations for
ever; and I resolved, once for all, to make him an example to those
who imagine themselves wise because they are old, and to teach
young men, who are too tame under representation, in what manner
grey-bearded insolence ought to be treated.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> I therefore one evening took my pen in hand, and
after having animated myself with a catch, wrote a general answer
to all his precepts, with such vivacity of turn, such elegance of
irony, and such asperity of sarcasm, that I convulsed a large
company with universal laughter, disturbing the neighbourhood with
vociferations of applause, and five days afterwards was answered,
that I must be content to live upon my own estate.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> This contraction of my income gave me no disturbance,
for a genius like mine was out of the reach of want. I had friends
that would be proud to open their purses at my call, and prospects
of such advancement as would soon reconcile my uncle, whom, upon
mature deliberation, I resolved to receive into favour, without
insisting on any acknowledgment of his offence, when the splendor
of my condition should induce him to wish for my countenance.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> I therefore went up to London before I had shewn the
alteration of my condition, by any abatement of my way of living,
and was received by all my academical acquaintance with triumph and
congratulation. I was immediately introduced among the wits and men
of spirit; and, in a short time, had divested myself of all my
scholar's gravity, and obtained the reputation of a pretty
fellow.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> You will easily believe that I had no great knowledge
of the world; yet I have been hindered by the general
disinclination every man feels to confess poverty, from telling to
any one the resolution of my uncle, and some time subsisted upon
the stock of money which I had brought with me, and contributed my
share as before to all our entertainments. But my pocket was soon
emptied, and I was obliged to ask my friends for a small sum.</p>
<p><b>14.</b> This was a favour which we had often reciprocally
received from one another, they supposed my wants only accidental,
and therefore willingly supplied them. In a short time, I found a
necessity of asking again, and was again treated with the same
civility, but the third time they began to wonder what that old
rogue my uncle could mean by sending a gentleman to town without
money; and when they gave me what I asked for, advised me to
stipulate for more regular remittances.</p>
<p><b>15.</b> This somewhat disturbed my dream of constant
affluence, but I was three days after completely awaked; for
entering the tavern, where we met every evening, I found the
waiters remitted their complaisance, and instead of contending to
light me up stairs, suffered me to wait for some minutes by the
bar.</p>
<p><b>16.</b> When I came to my company I found them unusually
grave and formal, and one of them took a hint to turn the
conversation upon the misconduct of young men, and enlarged upon
the folly of frequenting the company of men of fortune, without
being able to support the expence; an observation which the rest
contributed either to enforce by repetition, or to illustrate by
examples. Only one of them tried to divert the discourse, and
endeavoured to direct my attention to remote questions, and common
topics.</p>
<p><b>17.</b> A man guilty of poverty easily believes himself
suspected. I went, however, next morning to breakfast with him, who
appeared ignorant of the drift of the conversation, and by a series
of enquiries, drawing still nearer to the point, prevailed on him,
not, perhaps, much against his will, to inform me, that Mr.
<i>Dash</i>, whose father was a wealthy attorney near my native
place, had the morning before received an account of my uncle's
resentment, and communicated his intelligence with the utmost
industry of groveling insolence.</p>
<p><b>18.</b> It was no longer practicable to consort with my
former friends, unless I would be content to be used as an inferior
guest, who was to pay for his wine by mirth and flattery; a
character which, if I could not escape it, I resolved to endure
only among those who had never known me in the pride of plenty.</p>
<p><b>19.</b> I changed my lodgings, and frequented the coffee
houses in a different region of the town; where I was very quickly
distinguished by several young gentlemen of high birth, and large
estates, and began again to amuse my imagination with hopes of
preferment, though not quite so confidently as when I had less
experience.</p>
<p><b>20.</b> The first great conquest which this new scene enabled
me to gain over myself was, when I submitted to confess to a party,
who invited me to an expensive diversion, that my revenues were not
equal to such golden pleasures; they would not suffer me, however,
to stay behind, and with great reluctance I yielded to be treated.
I took that opportunity of recommending myself to some office or
employment, which they unanimously promised to procure me by their
joint interest.</p>
<p><b>21.</b> I had now entered into a state of dependence, and had
hopes, or fears, from almost every man I saw. If it be unhappy to
have one patron, what is his misery who has so many? I was obliged
to comply with a thousand caprices, to concur in a thousand
follies, and to countenance a thousand errors. I endured
innumerable mortifications, if not from cruelty, at least from
negligence, which will creep in upon the kindest and most delicate
minds, when they converse without the mutual awe of equal
condition.</p>
<p><b>22.</b> I found the spirit and vigour of liberty every moment
sinking in me, and a servile fear of displeasing, stealing by
degrees upon all my behaviour, till no word, or look, or action,
was my own. As the solicitude to please increased, the power of
pleasing grew less, and I was always clouded with diffidence where
it was most my interest and wish to shine.</p>
<p><b>23.</b> My patrons, considering me as belonging to the
community, and, therefore, not the charge of any particular person,
made no scruple of neglecting any opportunity of promoting me,
which every one thought more properly the business of another. An
account of my expectations and disappointments, and the succeeding
vicissitudes of my life, I shall give you in my following letter,
which will be, I hope, of use to shew how ill he forms his schemes,
who expects happiness without freedom.</p>

<p><b>1.</b> As it is natural for every man to think himself of
importance, your knowledge of the world will incline you to forgive
me, if I imagine your curiosity so much excited by the former part
of my narration, as to make you desire that I should proceed
without any unnecessary arts of connection. I shall, therefore, not
keep you longer in such suspence, as perhaps my performance may not
compensate.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> In the gay company with which I was now united, I
found those allurements and delights, which the friendship of young
men always affords; there was that openness which naturally
produced confidence, and that ardour of profession which excited
hope.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> When our hearts were dilated with merriment, promises
were poured out with unlimited profusion, and life and fortune were
but a scanty sacrifice to friendship; but when the hour came, at
which any effort was to be made, I had generally the vexation to
find, that my interest weighed nothing against the slightest
amusement, and that every petty avocation was found a sufficient
plea for continuing me in uncertainty and want.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> Their kindness was indeed sincere, when they promised
they had no intention to deceive; but the same juvenile warmth
which kindled their benevolence, gave force in the same proportion
to every other passion, and I was forgotten as soon as any new
pleasure seized on their attention.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> <i>Vagrio</i> told me one evening, that all my
perplexities should soon be at an end, and desired me, from that
instant, to throw upon him all care of my fortune, for a post of
considerable value was that day become vacant, and he knew his
interest sufficient to procure it in the morning. He desired me to
call on him early, that he might be dressed soon enough to wait
upon the minister before any other application should be made.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> I came as he appointed, with all the flame of
gratitude, and was told by his servant, that having found at his
lodgings, when he came home, an acquaintance who was going to
travel, he had been persuaded to accompany him to Dover, and that
they had taken post-horses two hours before day.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> I was once very near to preferment by the kindness of
<i>Charinus</i>; who, at my request, went to beg a place, which he
thought me likely to fill with great reputation, and in which I
should have many opportunities of promoting his interest in return;
and he pleased himself with imagining the mutual benefits that we
should confer, and the advances that we should make by our united
strength.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> Away, therefore, he went, equally warm with friendship
and ambition, and left me to prepare acknowledgements against his
return. At length he came back, and told me that he had met in his
way a party going to breakfast in the country, that the ladies
importuned him too much to be refused, and that having passed the
morning with them, he was come back to dress himself for a ball, to
which he was invited for the evening.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> I have suffered several disappointments from taylors
and perriwig-makers, who, by neglecting to perform their work,
withheld my patrons from court, and once failed of an establishment
for life by the delay of a servant, sent to a neighbouring shop to
replenish a snuff-box.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> At last I thought my solicitude at an end, for an
office fell into the gift of <i>Hippodamus</i>'s father, who being
then in the country, could not very speedily fill it, and whose
fondness would not have suffered him to refuse his son a less
reasonable request. <i>Hippodamus</i> therefore set forward with
great expedition, and I expected every hour an account of his
success.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> A long time I waited without any intelligence, but at
last received a letter from Newmarket, by which I was informed,
that the races were begun, and I knew the vehemence of his passion
too well to imagine that he could refuse himself his favourite
amusement.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> You will not wonder that I was at last weary of the
patronage of young men, especially as I found them not generally to
promise much greater fidelity as they advanced in life; for I
observed that what they gained in steadiness, they lost in
benevolence, and grew colder to my interest as they became more
diligent to promote their own.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> I was convinced that their liberality was only
profuseness, that, as chance directed, they were equally generous
to vice and virtue, that they were warm, but because they were
thoughtless, and counted the support of a friend only amongst other
gratifications of passion.</p>
<p><b>14.</b> My resolution was now to ingratiate myself with men
whose reputation was established, whose high stations enabled them
to prefer me, and whose age exempted them from sudden changes of
inclination; I was considered as a man of parts, and therefore
easily found admission to the table of <i>Hilarius</i>, the
celebrated orator, renowned equally for the extent of his
knowledge, the elegance of his diction, and the acuteness of his
wit.</p>
<p><b>15.</b> <i>Hilarius</i> received me with an appearance of
great satisfaction, produced to me all his friends, and directed to
me that part of his discourse in which he most endeavoured to
display his imagination. I had now learned my own interest enough
to supply him with opportunities for smart remarks and gay sallies,
which I never failed to echo and applaud.</p>
<p><b>16.</b> Thus I was gaining every hour on his affections,
till, unfortunately, when the assembly was more splendid than
usual, his desire of admiration prompted him to turn raillery upon
me. I bore it for some time with great submission, and success
encouraged him to redouble his attacks; at last my vanity prevailed
over my prudence; I retorted his irony with such spirit, that
<i>Hilarius</i>, unaccustomed to resistance, was disconcerted, and
soon found means of convincing me, that his purpose was not to
encourage a rival, but to foster a parasite.</p>
<p><b>17.</b> I was then taken into the familiarity of
<i>Argurio</i>, a nobleman eminent for judgment and criticism. He
had contributed to my reputation, by the praises which he had often
bestowed upon my writings, in which he owned that there were proofs
of a genius that might rise high to degrees of excellence, when
time, or information, had reduced its exuberance.</p>
<p><b>18.</b> He therefore required me to consult him before the
publication of any new performance, and commonly proposed
innumerable alterations, without, sufficient attention to the
general design, or regard to my form of style, and mode of
imagination.</p>
<p><b>19.</b> But these corrections he never failed to press as
indispensably necessary, and thought the least delay of compliance
an act of rebellion. The pride of an author made this treatment
insufferable, and I thought any tyranny easier to be borne than
that which took from me the use of my understanding.</p>
<p><b>20.</b> My next patron was <i>Eutyches</i> the statesman, who
was wholly engaged in public affairs, and seemed to have no
ambition but to be powerful and rich. I found his favour more
permanent than that of the others, for there was a certain price at
which it might be bought; he allowed nothing to humour or
affection, but was always ready to pay liberally for the service he
required.</p>
<p><b>21.</b> His demands were, indeed, very often such as virtue
could not easily consent to gratify; but virtue is not to be
consulted when men are to raise their fortunes by favour of the
great. His measures were censured; I wrote in his defence, and was
recompensed with a place, of which the profits were never received
by me without the pangs of remembering that they were the reward of
wickedness; a reward which nothing but that necessity, which the
consumption of my little estate in these wild pursuits had brought
upon me, hindered me from throwing back in the face of my
corruptor.</p>
<p><b>22.</b> At this time my uncle died without a will, and I
became heir to a small fortune. I had resolution to throw off the
splendor which reproached me to myself, and retire to an humbler
state, in which I am now endeavouring to recover the dignity of
virtue, and hope to make some reparation for my crimes and follies,
by informing others who may be led after the same pageants, that
they are about to engage in a course of life, in which they are to
purchase, by a thousand miseries, the privilege of repentance.</p>

75.</div>
<p><b>1.</b> The diligence with which you endeavour to cultivate
the knowledge of nature, manners, and life, will perhaps incline
you to pay some regard to the observations of one who has been
taught to know mankind by unwelcome information, and whose opinions
are the result, not of solitary conjectures, but of practice and
experience.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> I was born to a large fortune, and bred to the
knowledge of those arts which are supposed to accomplish the mind,
and adorn the person of a woman. To these attainments, which custom
and education almost forced upon me, I added some voluntary
acquisitions by the use of books and the conversation of that
species of men whom the ladies generally mention with terror and
aversion under the name of scholars, but whom I have found a
harmless and inoffensive order of beings, not no much wiser than
ourselves, but that they may receive as well as communicate
knowledge, and more inclined to degrade their own character by
cowardly submission, than to overbear or oppress us with their
learning or their wit.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> From these men, however, if they are by kind treatment
encouraged to talk, something may be gained, which, embelished with
elegancy, and softened by modesty, will always add dignity and
value to female conversation; and from my acquaintance with the
bookish part of the world, I derived many principles of judgment
and maxims of prudence, by which I was enabled to draw upon myself
the general regard in every place of concourse or pleasure.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> My opinion was the great rule of approbation, my
remarks were remembered by those who desired the second degree of
fame, my mein was studied, my dress imitated, my letters were
handed from one family to another, and read by those who copied
them as sent to themselves; my visits were solicited as honours,
and multitudes boasted of an intimacy with Melissa, who had only
seen me by accident, whose familiarity had never proceeded beyond
the exchange of a compliment, or return of a courtesy.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> I shall make no scruple of confessing that I was
pleased with this universal veneration, because I always considered
it as paid to my intrinsic qualities and inseparable merit, and
very easily persuaded myself, that fortune had no part in my
superiority.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> When I looked upon my glass, I saw youth and beauty,
with health that might give me reason to hope their continuance:
when I examined my mind, I found some strength of judgment and
fertility of fancy, and was told that every action was grace, and
that every accent was persuasion.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> In this manner my life passed like a continual triumph
amidst acclamations, and envy, and courtship, and caresses: to
please Melissa was the general ambition, and every stratagem of
artful flattery was practised upon me. To be flattered is grateful,
even when we know that our praises are not believed by those who
pronounce them: for they prove at least our power, and shew that
our favour is valued, since it is purchased by the meanness of
falsehood.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> But perhaps the flatterer is not often detected, for
an honest mind is not apt to suspect, and no one exerts the power
of discernment with much vigour when self-love favours the
deceit.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> The number of adorers, and the perpetual distraction
of my thoughts by new schemes of pleasures, prevented me from
listening to any of those who crowd in multitudes to give girls
advice, and kept me unmarried and unengaged to my twenty-seventh
year, when, as I was towering in all the pride of uncontested
excellency, with a face yet little impaired, and a mind hourly
improving, the failure of a fund, in which my money was placed,
reduced me to a frugal competency, which allowed a little beyond
neatness and independence.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> I bore the diminution of my riches without any
outrages of sorrow, or pusillanimity of dejection. Indeed I did not
know how much I had lost, for having always heard and thought more
of my wit and beauty, than of my fortune, it did not suddenly enter
my imagination, that Melissa could sink beneath her established
rank, while her form and her mind continued the same; that she
should cease to raise admiration, but by ceasing to deserve it, or
feel any stroke but from the hand of time.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> It was in my power to have concealed the loss, and to
have married, by continuing the same appearance, with all the
credit of my original fortune; but I was not so far sunk in my
esteem, as to submit to the baseness of fraud, or to desire any
other recommendation than sense and virtue.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> I therefore dismissed my equipage, sold those
ornaments which were become unsuitable to my new condition, and
appeared among those with whom I used to converse with less
glitter, but with equal spirit.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> I found myself received at every visit with sorrow
beyond what is naturally felt for calamities in which we have no
part, and was entertained with condolence and consolation so
frequently repeated, that my friends plainly consulted rather their
own gratification, than my relief.</p>
<p><b>14.</b> Some from that time refused my acquaintance, and
forebore without any provocation, to repay my visits; some visited
me, but after a longer interval than usual, and every return was
still with more delay; nor did any of my female acquaintances fail
to introduce the mention of my misfortunes, to compare my present
and former condition, to tell me how much it must trouble me to
want that splendor which I became so well; to look at pleasures,
which I had formerly enjoyed, and to sink to a level with those by
whom I had been considered as moving in a higher sphere, and who
had hitherto approached me with reverence and submission, which I
was now no longer to expect.</p>
<p><b>15.</b> Observations like these are commonly nothing better
than covert insults, which serve to give vent to the flatulence of
pride, but they are now and then imprudently uttered by honesty and
benevolence, and inflict pain where kindness is intended; I will,
therefore, so far maintain my antiquated claim to politeness, as to
venture the establishment of this rule, that no one ought to remind
another of misfortunes of which the sufferer does not complain, and
which there are no means proposed of alleviating.</p>
<p><b>16.</b> You have no right to excite thoughts which
necessarily give pain whenever they return, and which, perhaps,
might not have revived but by absurd and unseasonable
compassion.</p>
<p><b>17.</b> My endless train of lovers immediately withdrew
without raising any emotions. The greater part had indeed always
professed to court, as it is termed upon the square, had enquired
my fortune, and offered settlements; these undoubtedly had a right
to retire without censure, since they had openly treated for money,
as necessary to their happiness, and who can tell how little they
wanted any other portion?</p>
<p><b>18.</b> I have always thought the clamours of women
unreasonable, who imagine themselves injured, because the men who
followed them upon the supposition of a greater fortune, reject
them when they are discovered to have less. I have never known any
lady, who did not think wealth a title to some stipulations in her
favour; and surely what is claimed by the possession of money, is
justly forfeited by its loss.</p>
<p><b>19.</b> She that has once demanded a settlement, has allowed
the importance of fortune; and when she cannot shew pecuniary
merit, why should she think her cheapner obliged to purchase?</p>
<p><b>20.</b> My lovers were not all contented with silent
desertion. Some of them revenged the neglect which they had
formerly endured by wanton and superfluous insults, and endeavoured
to mortify me, by paying in my presence those civilities to other
ladies, which were once devoted only to me.</p>
<p><b>21.</b> But as it had been my rule to treat men according to
the rank of their intellect, I had never suffered any one to waste
his life in suspense who could have employed it to better purpose,
and had therefore no enemies but coxcombs, whose resentment and
respect were equally below my consideration.</p>
<p><b>22.</b> The only pain which I have felt from degradation, is
the loss of that influence which I have always exerted on the side
of virtue, in the defence of innocence and the assertion of truth.
I now find my opinions slighted, my sentiments criticised, and my
arguments opposed by those that used to listen to me without reply,
and struggle to be first in expressing their conviction.</p>
<p><b>23.</b> The female disputants have wholly thrown off my
authority, and if I endeavour to enforce my reasons by an appeal to
the scholars that happen to be present, the wretches are certain to
pay their court by sacrificing me and my system to a finer gown;
and I am every hour insulted with contradiction by cowards, who
could never find till lately, that Melissa was liable to error.</p>
<p><b>24.</b> There are two persons only whom I cannot charge with
having changed their conduct with my change of fortune. One is an
old curate, that has passed his life in the duties of his
profession, with great reputation for his knowledge and piety; the
other is a lieutenant of dragoons. The parson made no difficulty in
the height of my elevation, to check me when I was pert, and
instruct me when I blundered; and if there is any alteration, he is
now more timorous lest his freedom should be thought rudeness.</p>
<p><b>25.</b> The soldier never paid me any particular addresses,
but very rigidly observed all the rules of politeness, which he is
now so far from relaxing, that whenever he serves the tea, he
obstinately carries me the first dish, in defiance of the frowns
and whispers of the table.</p>
<p><b>26.</b> This, Mr. Rambler, is <i>to see the world</i>. It is
impossible for those that have only known affluence and prosperity,
to judge rightly of themselves or others. The rich and the powerful
live in a perpetual masquerade, in which all about them wear
borrowed characters; and we only discover in what estimation we are
held, when we can no longer give hopes or fears.</p>

<p><b>1.</b> I was yesterday about sun-set walking in the open
fields, till the night insensibly fell upon me. I at first amused
myself with all the richness and variety of colours, which appeared
in the western parts of heaven; in proportion as they faded away
and went out, several stars and planets appeared one after another,
till the whole firmament was in a glow. The blueness of the
&aelig;ther was exceedingly heightened and enlivened by the season
of the year, and by the rays of all those luminaries that passed
through it.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> The <i>Galaxy</i> appeared in its most beautiful
white. To complete the scene, the full moon rose at length in that
clouded majesty, which <i>Milton</i> takes notice of, and opened to
the eye a new picture of nature, which was more finely shaded, and
disposed among softer lights, than that which the sun had before
discovered to us.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> As I was surveying the moon, walking in her
brightness, and taking her progress among the constellations, a
thought rose in me which I believe very often perplexes and
disturbs men of serious and contemplative natures. <i>David</i>
himself fell into it in that reflection, <i>When I consider the
heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and stars which thou
hast ordained; what is man, that thou art mindful of him, and the
son of man, that thou regardest him!</i></p>
<p><b>4.</b> In the same manner, when I consider that infinite host
of stars, or, to speak more philosophically, of suns, who were then
shining upon me, with those innumerable sets of planets or worlds,
which were moving round their respective suns; when I still
enlarged the idea, and supposed another heaven of suns and worlds
rising still above this which he had discovered, and these still
enlightened by a superior firmament of luminaries, which are
planted at so great a distance, that they may appear to the
inhabitants of the former as the stars do to us; in short, while I
pursued this thought, I could not but reflect on that little
insignificant figure which I myself bore amidst the immensity of
God's works.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> Were the sun, which enlightens this part of the
creation, with all the host of planetary worlds that move about
him, utterly extinguished and annihilated, they would not be
missed, more than a grain of sand upon the sea-shore. The space
they possess is so exceedingly little in comparison of the whole,
that it would scarce make a blank in the creation. The chasm would
be imperceptible to an eye that could take in the whole compass of
nature, and pass from one end of the creation to the other; as it
is possible there may be such a sense in ourselves hereafter, or in
creatures which are at present more exalted than ourselves.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> We see many stars by the help of glasses, which we do
not discover with our naked eyes; and the finer our telescopes are,
the more still are our discoveries. <i>Huygenius</i> carries his
thought so far, that he does not think it impossible there may be
stars whose light is not yet travelled down to us, since their
first creation. There is no question but the universe has certain
bounds set to it; but when we consider that it is the work of
infinite power, prompted by infinite goodness, with an infinite
space to exert itself in, how can our imagination set any bounds to
it!</p>
<p><b>7.</b> To return, therefore, to my first thought, I could not
but look upon myself with secret horror, as a being that was not
worth the smallest regard of one who had so great a work under his
care and superintendency. I was afraid of being overlooked amidst
the immensity of nature, and lost among that infinite variety of
creatures, which in all probability swarm through all these
immeasurable regions of matter.</p>
<p>In order to recover myself from this mortifying thought, I
consider that it took its rise from those narrow conceptions which
we are apt to maintain of the divine nature. We ourselves cannot
attend to many different objects at the same time. If we are
careful to inspect some things, we must of course neglect
others.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> This imperfection which we observe in ourselves, is an
imperfection that cleaves in some degree to creatures of the
highest capacities, as they are creatures, that is, beings of
finite and limited natures. The presence of every created being is
confined to a certain measure of space, and consequently his
observation is stinted to a certain number of objects. The sphere
in which we move, and act, and understand, is of a wider
circumference to one creature than another, according as we rise
one above another in the scale of existence.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> But the widest of these our spheres has its
circumference. When, therefore, we reflect on the divine nature, we
are so used and accustomed to this imperfection in ourselves, that
we cannot forbear in some measure ascribing it to him in whom there
is no shadow of imperfection. Our reason indeed ascribes that his
attributes are infinite, but the poorness of our conceptions is
such, that it cannot forbear setting bounds to every thing it
contemplates, till our reason comes again to our succour, and
throws down all those little prejudices which rise in us unawares,
and are natural to the mind of man.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> We shall therefore utterly extinguish this melancholy
thought, of our being overlooked by our Maker in the multiplicity
of his works, and the infinity of those objects among which he
seems to be incessantly employed, if we consider, in the first
place, that he is omnipresent, and in the second, that he is
omniscient.</p>
<p>If we consider him in his omnipresence; his being passes
through, actuates and supports the whole frame of nature. His
creation, and every part of it, is full of him.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> There is nothing he has made, that is either so
distant, so little, or so inconsiderable, which he does not
essentially inhabit. His substance is within the substance of every
being, whether material or immaterial, and is intimately present to
it, as that being is to itself. It would be an imperfection in him,
were he able to remove out of one place into another, or to
withdraw himself from any thing he has created, or from any part of
that space which is diffused and spread abroad to infinity. In
short, to speak of him in the language of the old philosophers, He
is a being whose centre is every where, and his circumference no
where.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> In the second place, he is omniscient as well as
omnipresent. His omniscience, indeed, necessarily and naturally
flows from his omnipresence. He cannot but be conscious of every
motion that arises in the whole material world, which he thus
essentially pervades; and of every thought that is stirring in the
intellectual world, to every part of which he is thus intimately
united. Several moralists have considered the creation as the
temple of God, which he has built with his own hands, and which is
filled with his presence.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> Others have considered infinite space as the
receptacle, or rather the habitation of the Almighty; but the
noblest, and most exalted way of considering this infinite space,
is that of Sir <i>Isaac Newton</i>, who calls it the
<i>sensorium</i> of the Godhead. Brutes and men have their
<i>sensoria</i>, or little <i>sensoriums</i>, by which they
apprehend the presence and perceive the actions of a few objects
that lie contiguous to them. Their knowledge and apprehension turn
within a very narrow circle. But as God Almighty cannot but
perceive and know every thing in which he resides, infinite space
gives room to infinite knowledge, and is, as it were, an organ to
omniscience.</p>
<p><b>14.</b> Were the soul separate from the body, and with one
glance of thought should start beyond the bounds of the creation;
should it for millions of years continue its progress through
infinite space with the same activity, it would still find itself
within the embraces of its Creator, and encompassed round with the
immensity of the Godhead. While we are in the body, he is hot less
present with us because he is concealed from us. <i>Oh that I knew
where I might find him</i>! says Job. <i>Behold I go forward, but
he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him; on the
left hand, where he does work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth
himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him.</i> In short,
reason as well as revelation assures us, that he cannot be absent
from us, notwithstanding he is undiscovered by us.</p>
<p><b>15.</b> In this consideration of God Almighty's omnipresence
and omniscience, every uncomfortable thought vanishes. He cannot
but regard every thing that has beings especially such of his
creatures who fear they are not regarded by him. He is privy to all
their thoughts, and to that anxiety of heart in particular, which
is apt to trouble them on this occasion; for, as it is impossible
he should overlook any of his creatures, so we may be confident
that he regards, with an eye of mercy, those who endeavour to
recommend themselves to his notice, and in unfeigned humility of
heart think themselves unworthy that he should be mindful of
them.</p>

<p><b>1.</b> In your paper of Friday the 9th instant, you had
occasion to consider the ubiquity of the Godhead; and at the same
time to shew, that as he is presented every thing, he cannot but be
attentive to every thing, and privy to all the modes and parts of
its existence; or, in other words, that his omniscience and
omnipresence are co-existent, and run together through the whole
infinitude of space.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> This consideration might furnish us with many
incentives to devotion, and motives to morality; but as this
subject has been handled by several excellent writers, I shall
consider it in a light wherein I have not seen it placed by
others.</p>
<p><i>First</i>, How disconsolate is the condition of an
intellectual being who is thus present with his Maker, but at the
same time receives no extraordinary benefit or advantage from this
his presence!</p>
<p><b>3.</b> <i>Secondly</i>, How deplorable is the condition of an
intellectual being, who feels no other effects from this his
presence, but such as proceed from divine wrath and
indignation!</p>
<p><i>Thirdly</i>, How happy is the condition of that intellectual
being, who is sensible of his Maker's presence from the secret
effects of his mercy and loving kindness!</p>
<p><b>4.</b> <i>first</i>, How disconsolate is the condition of an
intellectual being who is thus present with his Maker, but at the
same time receives no extraordinary benefit or advantage from this
his presence! Every particle of matter is actuated by this Almighty
Being which passes through it. The heavens and the earth, the stars
and planets, move, and gravitate by virtue of this great principle
within them. All the dead parts of nature are invigorated by the
presence of their Creator, and made capable of exerting their
respective qualities.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> The several instincts in the brute creation do
likewise operate and work towards the several ends which, are
agreeable to them, by this divine energy. Man only, who does not
co-operate with his holy spirit, and is unattentive to his
presence, receives none of these advantages from it, which are
perfective of his nature, and necessary to his well-being. The
divinity is with him, and in him, and every where about him, but of
no advantage to him.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> It is the same thing to a man without religion, as if
there were no God in the world. It is indeed impossible for an
infinite Being to remove, himself from any of his creatures; but
though he cannot withdraw his essence from us, which would argue an
imperfection in him, he can withdraw from us all the joys and
consolations of it. His presence may, perhaps, be necessary to
support us in our existence; but he may leave this our existence to
itself, with regard to our happiness or misery.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> For, in this sense, he may cast us away from his
presence, and take his holy spirit from us. This single
consideration one would think sufficient to make us open our hearts
to all those infusions of joy and gladness which are so near at
hand, and ready to be poured in upon us; especially when we
consider, <i>secondly</i>, the deplorable condition of an
intellectual being who feels no other effects from his Maker's
presence, but such as proceed from divine wrath and
indignation!</p>
<p><b>8.</b> We may assure ourselves, that the great Author of
Nature, will not always be as one who is indifferent to any of his
creatures. Those who will not feel him in his love, will be sure at
length to feel him in his displeasure. And how dreadful is the
condition of that creature who is only sensible of the being of his
Creator by what he suffers from him! He is as essentially present
in hell as in heaven; but the inhabitants of those accursed places
behold him only in his wrath, and shrink within the flames to
conceal themselves from him. It is not in the power of imagination
to conceive the fearful effects of Omnipotence incensed.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> But I shall only consider the wretchedness of an
intellectual being, who, in this life, lies under the displeasure
of him, that at all times, and in all places, is intimately united
with him. He is able to disquiet the soul, and vex it in all its
faculties, He can hinder any of the greatest comforts of life from
refreshing us, and give an edge to every one of its slightest
calamities.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> Who then can bear the thought of being an outcast
from his presence, that is, from the comforts of it, or of feeling
it only in its terrors? how pathetic is that expostulation of
<i>Job</i>, when for the real trial of his patience, he was made to
look upon himself in this deplorable condition! <i>Why hast thou
set me as a mark against thee so that I am become a burden to
myself?</i> But <i>thirdly</i>, how happy is the condition of that
intellectual being, who is sensible of his Maker's presence from
the secret effects of his mercy and loving kindness!</p>
<p><b>11.</b> The blessed in heaven behold him face to face, that
is, are as sensible of his presence as we are of the presence of
any person whom we look upon with our eyes. There is doubtless a
faculty in spirits, by which they apprehend one another, as our
senses do material objects; and there is no question but our souls,
when they are disembodied, or placed in glorified bodies, will by
this faculty, in whatever space they reside, be always sensible of
the divine presence.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> We who have this veil of flesh standing between us
and the world of spirits, must be content to know the spirit of God
is present with us, by the effects which he produceth in us. Our
outward senses are too gross to apprehend him; we may however taste
and see how gracious he is, by his influence upon our minds, by
those virtuous thoughts which he awakens in us, by those secret
comforts and refreshments which he conveys into our souls, and by
those ravishing joys and inward satisfactions which are perpetually
springing up, and diffusing themselves among all the thoughts of
good men.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> He is lodged in our very essence, and is as a soul
within the soul to irradiate its understanding, rectify its will,
purify its passions, and enliven all the powers of man. How happy
therefore is an intellectual being, who by prayer and meditation,
by virtue and good works, opens this communication between God and
his own soul! Though the whole creation frowns upon him, and all
nature looks black about him, he has his light and support within
him, that are able to cheer his mind, and bear him up in the midst
of all those horrors which encompass him.</p>
<p><b>14.</b> He knows that his helper is at hand, and is always
nearer to him than any thing else can be, which is capable of
annoying or terrifying him. In the midst of calumny or contempt, he
attends to that Being who whispers better things within his soul,
and whom he looks upon as his defender, his glory and the lifter up
of his head. In his deepest solitude and retirement, he knows that
he is in company with the greatest of beings: and perceives within
himself such real sensations of his presence, as are more
delightful than any thing that can be met with in the conversations
of his creatures.</p>
<p><b>15.</b> Even in the hour of death, he considers the pains of
his dissolution to be nothing else but the breaking down of that
partition, which stands betwixt his soul and the sight of that
Being who is always present with him, and is about to manifest
itself to him in fulness of Joy.</p>
<p><b>16.</b> If we would be thus happy and thus sensible of our
Maker's presence, from the secret effects of his mercy and
goodness, we must keep such a watch over all our thoughts, that, in
the language of the scripture, His soul may have pleasure in us. We
must take care not to grieve his holy spirit, and endeavour to make
the meditations of our hearts always acceptable in his sight, that
he may delight thus to reside and dwell in us.</p>
<p><b>17.</b> The light of nature could direct <i>Seneca</i> to
this doctrine in a very remarkable passage among his epistles;
<i>Sacer inest in nobis spiritus, bonorum malorumque custos et
observator; et quemadmodum nos illum tractamus, ita et ille
nos</i>. 'There is a holy spirit residing in us, who watches and
observes both good and evil men, and will treat us after the same
manner that we treat him.' But I shall conclude this discourse with
those more emphatical words in divine revelation: <i>If a man love
me, he will keep my words; and my father will love him, and we will
come unto him, and make our abode with him</i>.</p>

<h2><i>Reflections on the third Heaven</i>.</h2>
<div style='text-align: right; margin-right: 10%;'>SPECTATOR, No.
580.</div>
<p><b>1.</b> I considered in my two last letters, that awful and
tremendous subject, the ubiquity or Omnipresence of the Divine
Being. I have shewn that he is equally present in all places
throughout the whole extent of infinite space. This doctrine is so
agreeable to reason, that we meet with it in the writings of the
enlightened heathens, as I might shew at large, were it not already
done by other hands. But though the Deity be thus essentially
present through all the immensity of space, there is one part of it
in which he discovers himself in a most transcendant and visible
glory.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> This is that place which is marked out in scripture
under the different appellations of <i>Paradise, the third Heaven,
the throne of God, and the habitation of his glory</i>. It is here
where the glorified body of our Saviour resides, and where all the
celestial hierarchies, and innumerable hosts of angels, are
represented as perpetually surrounding the seat of God with
hallelujahs and hymns of praise. This is that presence of God which
some of the divines call his glorious, and others his majestic
presence.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> He is indeed as essentially present in all other
places as in this; but it is here where he resides in a sensible
magnificence, and in the midst of all these splendors which can
affect the imagination of created beings.</p>
<p>It is very remarkable that this opinion of God Almighty's
presence in heaven, whether discovered by the light of nature, or
by a general tradition from our first parents, prevails among all
the nations of the world, whatsoever different notions they
entertain of the Godhead.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> If you look into <i>Homer</i>, that is, the most
ancient of the <i>Greek</i> writers, you see the Supreme power
seated in the heavens, and encompassed with inferior deities, among
whom the muses are represented as singing incessantly about his
throne. Who does not here see the main strokes and outlines of this
great truth we are speaking of?</p>
<p><b>5.</b> The same doctrine is shadowed out in many other
heathen authors, though at the same time, like several other
revealed truths, dashed and adulterated with a mixture of fables
and human inventions. But to pass over the notions of the
<i>Greeks</i> and <i>Romans</i>, those more enlightened parts of
the pagan world, we find there is scarce a people among the late
discovered nations who are not trained up in an opinion that heaven
is the habitation of the divinity whom they worship.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> As in <i>Solomon's</i> temple there was the <i>Sanctum
Sanctorum</i>, in which a visible glory appeared among the figures
of the cherubims, and into which none but the high-priest himself
was permitted to enter, after having made an atonement for the sins
of the people; so, if we consider this whole creation as one great
temple, there is in it the Holy of Holies, into which the
high-priest of our salvation entered, and took his place among
angels and archangels, after having made a propitiation for the
sins of mankind.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> With how much skill must the throne of God be erected?
With what glorious designs is that habitation beautified, which is
contrived and built by him who inspired <i>Hiram</i> with wisdom?
How great must be the majesty of that place, where the whole art of
creation has been employed, and where God has chosen to shew
himself in the most magnificent manner? What must be the
architecture of infinite power under the direction of divine
wisdom? A spirit cannot but be transported after an ineffable
manner with the sight of those objects, which were made to affect
him by that being who knows the inward frame of a soul, and how to
please and ravish it in all its most secret powers and
faculties.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> It is to this majestic presence of God we may apply
those beautiful expressions in holy writ: <i>Behold even to the
moon, and it shineth not; yea, the stars are not pure in his
sight</i>. The light of the sun, and all the glories of the world
in which we live, are but as weak and sickly glimmerings, or rather
darkness itself, in comparison of those splendors which encompass
the throne of God.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> As the glory of this place is transcendent beyond
imagination, so probably is the extent of it. There is light behind
light, and glory within glory. How far that space may reach, in
which God thus appears in perfect majesty, we cannot possibly
conceive. Though it is not infinite, it may be indefinite; and
though not immeasurable in itself, it may be so with regard to any
created eye or imagination. If he has made these lower regions of
matter so inconceivably wide and magnificent for the habitation of
mortal and perishable beings, how great may we suppose the courts
of his house to be, where he makes his residence in a more especial
manner, and displays himself in the fulness of his glory, among an
innumerable company of angels, and spirits of just men made
perfect!</p>
<p><b>10.</b> This is certain, that our imaginations cannot be
raised too high, when we think on a place where omnipotence and
omniscience have so signally exerted themselves, because that they
are able to produce a scene infinitely more great and glorious than
what we are able to imagine.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> It is not impossible but at the consummation of all
things, these outward apartments of nature, which are now suited to
those beings who inhabit them, may be taken in and added to that
glorious place of which I am here speaking; and by that means made
a proper habitation for beings who are exempt from mortality, and
cleared of their imperfections: for so the scripture seems to
intimate, when it speaks of new heavens and of a new earth, wherein
dwelleth righteousness.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> I have only considered this glorious place with
regard to the sight and imagination, though it is highly probable,
that our other senses may here likewise enjoy then highest
gratifications. There is nothing which more ravishes and transports
the soul, than harmony; and we have great reason to believe, from
the description of this place in Holy scripture, that this is one
of the entertainments of it.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> And if the soul of man can be so wonderfully affected
with those strains of music, which human art is capable of
producing, how much more will it be raised and elevated by those,
in which is exerted the whole power of harmony! The senses are
faculties of the human soul, though they cannot be employed, during
this our vital union, without proper instruments in the body.</p>
<p><b>14.</b> Why therefore should we exclude the satisfaction of
these faculties, which we find by experience are inlets of great
pleasure to the soul, from among these entertainments which are to
make our happiness hereafter? Why should we suppose that our
hearing and seeing will not be gratified by those objects which are
most agreeable to them, and which they cannot meet with in those
lower regions of nature; objects, <i>which neither eye hath seen,
nor ear heard, nor can it enter into the heart of man to
conceive</i>!</p>
<p><b>15.</b> <i>I knew a man in Christ</i> (says St. Paul,
speaking of himself) <i>above fourteen years ago</i> (<i>whether in
the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell:
God knoweth</i>) <i>such a one caught up to the third heaven. And I
knew such a man</i> (<i>whether in the body or out of the body, I
cannot tell: God knoweth</i>) <i>how that he was caught up into
Paradise, and heard unspeakable words which it is not possible for
a man to utter</i>.</p>
<p><b>16.</b> By this is meant that what he heard was so infinitely
different from any thing which he had heard in this world, that it
was impossible to express it in such words as might convey a notion
of it to his hearers.</p>
<p>It is very natural for us to take delight in inquiries
concerning any foreign country, where we are some time or other to
make our abode; and as we all hope to be admitted into this
glorious place, it is both a laudable and useful curiosity, to get
what information we can of it, while we make use of revelation for
our guide.</p>
<p><b>17.</b> When these everlasting doors shall be opened to us,
we may be sure that the pleasures and beauties of this place will
infinitely transcend our present hopes and expectations, and that
the glorious appearance of the throne of God will rise infinitely
beyond whatever we are able to conceive of it. We might here
entertain ourselves with many other speculations on this subject
from those several hints which we find of it in the holy
scriptures: as whether there may not be different mansions and
apartments of glory, to beings of different natures; whether, as
they: excel one another in perfection, they are not admitted nearer
to the throne of the Almighty, and enjoy greater manifestations of
his presence.</p>
<p><b>18.</b> Whether there are not solemn times and occasions,
when all the multitude of heaven celebrate the presence of their
Maker, in more extraordinary forms of praise and adoration; as
<i>Adam</i>, though he had continued in a state of innocence,
would, in the opinion of our divines, have kept holy the <i>Sabbath
day</i>, in a more particular manner than any other of the seven.
These, and the like speculations, we may very innocently indulge,
so long as we make use of them to inspire us with a desire of
becoming inhabitants of this delightful place.</p>
<p><b>19.</b> I have in this, and in two foregoing letters, treated
on the most serious subject that can employ the mind of man, the
omnipresence of the Deity; a subject which, if possible, should
never depart from our meditations. We have considered the Divine
Being, as he inhabits infinitude, as he dwells among his works, as
he is present to the mind of man, and as he discovers himself in a
more glorious manner among the regions of the blest. Such a
consideration should be kept awake in us at all times, and in all
places, and possess our minds with a perpetual awe and
reverence.</p>
<p><b>20.</b> It should be interwoven with all our thoughts and
perceptions, and become one with the consciousness of our own
being. It is not to be reflected on in the coldness of philosophy,
but ought to sink us into the lowest prostration before him, who is
so astonishingly, great, wonderful, and holy.</p>

<p><b>1.</b> A lewd young fellow seeing an aged hermit go by him
barefoot, <i>Father</i>, says he, <i>you are in a very miserable
condition, if there is not another world. True son</i>, said the
hermit; <i>but what is thy condition if there is</i>? Man is a
creature designed for two different states of being, or rather, for
two different lives. His first life is short and transient; his
second permanent and lasting.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> The question we are all concerned in is this, in which
of these two lives is our chief interest to make ourselves happy?
or in other words, whether we should endeavour to secure to
ourselves the pleasure and gratification of a life which is
uncertain and precarious, and at its utmost length of a very
inconsiderable duration; or to secure to ourselves the pleasure of
a life that is fixed and settled, and will never end? Every man,
upon the first hearing of this question, knows very well which side
of it he ought to close with.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> But however right we are in theory, it is plain that
in practice we adhere to the wrong side of the question. We make
provisions for this life as though it were never to have an end,
and for the other life as though it were never to have a
beginning.</p>
<p>Should a spirit of superior rank, who is a stranger to human
nature, accidentally alight upon the earth, and take a survey of
its inhabitants, what would his notions of us be?</p>
<p><b>4.</b> Would not he think that we were a species of beings
made for quite different ends and purposes than what we really are?
Must not he imagine that we were placed in this world to get riches
and honours? Would he not think that it was our duty to toil after
wealth, and station, and title? Nay, would not he believe we were
forbidden poverty by threats of eternal punishment, and enjoined to
pursue our pleasures under pain of damnation? He would certainly
imagine that we were influenced by a scheme of duties quite
opposite to those which are indeed prescribed to us.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> And truly, according to such an imagination, be must
conclude that we are a species of the most obedient creatures in
the universe; that we are constant to our duty; and that we keep a
steady eye on the end for which we were sent hither.</p>
<p>But how great would be his astonishment, when he learnt that we
were beings not designed to exist in this world above threescore
and ten years; and that the greatest part of this busy species fall
short even of that age?</p>
<p><b>6.</b> How would he be lost in horror and admiration, when he
should know that this set of creatures, who lay out all their
endeavours for this life, which scarce deserves the name of
existence, when, I say, he should know that this set of creatures
are to exist to all eternity in another life, for winch they make
no preparations?</p>
<p><b>7.</b> Nothing can be a greater disgrace to reason than that
men, who are persuaded of these two different states of being,
should be perpetually employed in providing for a life of
threescore and ten years, and neglecting to make provision for that
which, after many myriads of years, will be still new, and still
beginning; especially when we consider that our endeavours for
making ourselves great, or rich, or honourable, or whatever else we
place our happiness in, may, after all, prove unsuccessful; whereas
if we constantly and sincerely endeavour to make ourselves happy in
the other life, we are sure that our endeavours will succeed, and
that we shall not be disappointed of our hope.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> The following question is started by one of the
school-men: Supposing the whole body of the earth were a great ball
or mass of the finest sand, and that a single grain or particle of
this sand should be annihilated every thousand years. Supposing
then that you had it in your choice to be happy all the while this
prodigious mass of sand was consuming by this slow method till
there was not a grain, of it left, on condition you were to be
miserable for ever after; or supposing that you might be happy for
ever after, on condition you would be miserable till the whole mass
of sand were thus annihilated at the rate of one sand in a thousand
years: which of these two cases would you make your choice?</p>
<p><b>9.</b> It must be confessed in this case, so many thousands
of years are to the imagination as a kind of eternity, though in
reality they do not bear so great a proportion to that duration
which is to follow them, as an unit does to the greatest number
which you can put together in figures, or as one of those sands to
the supposed heap. Reason therefore tells us, without any manner of
hesitation, which would be the better part in this choice.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> However, as I have before intimated, our reason might
in such a case be so overset by the imagination, as to dispose some
persons to sink under the consideration of the great length of the
first part of this duration, and of the great distance of that
second duration, which is to succeed it. The mind, I say, might
give itself up to that happiness which is at hand, considering that
it is so very near, and that it would last so very long.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> But when the choice we actually have before us, is
this, whether we will chuse to be happy for the space of only
threescore and ten, nay, perhaps of only twenty or ten years, I
might say of only a day or an hour, and miserable to all eternity;
or, on the contrary, miserable for this short term of years, and
happy for a whole eternity; what words are sufficient to express
that folly and want of consideration which in such a case makes a
wrong choice?</p>
<p><b>12.</b> I here put the case even at the worst, by supposing
(what seldom happens) that a course of virtue makes us miserable in
this life: but if we suppose (as it generally happens) that virtue
will make us more happy even in this life than a contrary course of
vice; how can we sufficiently admire the stupidity or madness of
those persons who are capable of making so absurd a choice?</p>
<p><b>13.</b> Every wise man, therefore, will consider this life
only as it may conduce to the happiness of the other, and
cheerfully sacrifice the pleasures of a few years to those of an
eternity.</p>

<div style='text-align: right; margin-right: 10%;'>SPECTATOR, No.
111.</div>
<p><b>1.</b> I was yesterday walking alone in one of my friend's
woods, and lost myself in it very agreeably, as I was running over
in my mind the several arguments that establish this great point,
which is the basis of morality, and the source of all the pleasing
hopes and secret joys that can arise in the heart of a reasonable
creature.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> I considered those several proofs drawn: <i>First</i>,
From the nature of the soul itself, and particualrly its
immateriality; which, though not absolutely necessary to the
eternity of its duration, has, I think, been evinced to almost a
demonstration.</p>
<p><i>Secondly</i>, From its passions and sentiments, as
particularly from, its love of existence; its horror of
annihilation, and its hopes of immortality, with that secret
satisfaction which it finds in the practice of virtue, and that
uneasiness which follows in it upon the commission of vice.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> <i>Thirdly</i>, From the nature of the Supreme Being,
whose justice, goodness, wisdom and veraveracity, are all concerned
in this point.</p>
<p>But among these and other excellent arguments for the
immortality of the soul, there is one drawn from the perpetual
progress of the soul to its perfection, without a possibility of
ever arriving at it; which is a hint that I do not remember to have
seen opened and improved by others who have written on this
subject, though it seeras to me to carry a very great weight with
it.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> How can it enter into the thoughts of man, that the
soul which is capable of such immense perfection, and of receiving
new improvements to all eternity, shall fall away into nothing
almost as soon as it is created? are such abilities made for no
purpose? A brute arrives at a point of perfection that he can never
pass: in a few years he has all the endowments he is capable of;
and were he to live ten thousand more, would be the same thing he
is at present.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> Were a human soul thus at a stand in her
accomplishments, were her faculties to be full blown, and incapable
of further enlargements, I could imagine it might fall away
insensibly; and drop at once into a state of annihilation.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> But can we believe a thinking being; that is in a
perpetual progress of improvements, and travelling on from
perfection to perfection, after having just looked abroad into the
works of its Creator, and made a few discoveries of his infinite
goodness, wisdom and power, must perish at her first setting out,
and in the very beginning of her enquiries?</p>
<p>A man considered in his present state, seems only sent into the
world to propagate his kind. He provides himself with a successor,
and immediately quits his post to make room for him.</p>

<p><b>7.</b> He does net seem born to enjoy life, but to deliver it
down to others. This is not surprising to consider in animals,
which are formed for our use, and can finish their business in a
short life. The silk-worm, after having spun her task, lays her
eggs and dies. But a man can never have taken in his full measure
of knowledge, has not time to subdue his passions, establish his
soul in virtue, and come up to the perfection of his nature, before
he is hurried off the stage.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> Would an infinitely wise Being make such glorious
creatures for so mean a purpose? Can he delight in the production
of such abortive intelligences, such short-lived reasonable beings?
Would he give us talents that are not to be exerted? capacities
that are never to be gratified? How can we find that wisdom which
shines through all his works, in the formation of man, without
looking on this world as only a nursery for the next, and believing
that the several generations of rational creatures, which rise up
and disappear in such quick successions, are only to receive the
first rudiments of existence here, and afterwards to be
transplanted into a more friendly climate, where they may spread
and flourish to all eternity.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> There is not, in my opinion, a more pleasing and
triumphant consideration in religion than this of the perpetual
progress which the soul makes towards the perfection of its nature,
without ever arriving at a period in it. To look upon the soul as
going on from strength to strength, to consider that she is to
shine for ever with new accessions of glory, and brighten to all
eternity; that she will be still adding virtue to virtue, and
knowledge to knowledge; carries in it something wonderfully
agreeable to that ambition which is natural to the mind of man.
Nay, it must be a prospect pleasing to God himself, to see his
creation of ever beautifying his eyes, and drawing nearer to him,
by greater degrees of resemblance.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> Methinks this single consideration, of the progress
of a finite spirit to perfection, will be sufficient to extinguish
all envy in inferior natures, and all contempt in superior That
cherubim, which now appears as a God to a human soul, knows very
well that the period will come about in eternity when the human
soul shall be as perfect as he himself now is: nay, when she shall
look down upon that degree of perfection as much as she now falls
short of it. It is true, the higher nature still advances, and by
that means preserves his distance and superiority in the scale of
being; but he knows that, how high soever the station is of which
he stands possessed at present, the inferior nature will at length
mount up to it, and shine forth in the same degree of glory.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> With what astonishment and veneration may we look
into our own soul, where there are such hidden stores of virtue and
knowledge, such inexhausted sources of perfection! We know not yet
what we shall be, nor will it ever enter into the heart of man to
conceive the glory that will be always in reserve for him. The soul
considered with its Creator, is like one of those mathematical
lines that may draw nearer to another for all eternity, without a
possibility of touching it: and can there be a thought so
transporting, as to consider ourselves in these perpetual
approaches to him, who is not only the standard of perfection, but
of happiness!</p>

<p><b>1.</b> Though there is a great deal of pleasure in
contemplating the material world, by which I mean that system of
bodies into which nature has so curiously wrought the mass of dead
matter, with the several relations which, those bodies bear to one
another; there is still, methinks, something more wonderful and
surprising in contemplations on the world of life, by which I mean
all those animals with which every part of the universe is
furnished.</p>
<p>The material world, is only the shell of the universe: the world
of life are its inhabitants.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> If we consider those parts of the material world which
lie the nearest to us, and are therefore subject to our
observations and inquiries, it is amazing to consider the infinity
of animals with which it is stocked. Every part of matter is
peopled: every green leaf swarms with inhabitants. There is scarce
a single humour of the body of a man, or of any other animal, in
which our glasses do not discover myriads of living creatures.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> The surface of animals, is also covered with other
animals, which are in the same manner the basis of other animals
that live upon it: nay, we find in the most solid bodies, as in
marble itself, innumerable cells and cavities, that are crowded
with such imperceptible inhabitants, as are too little for the
naked eye to discover. On the other hand, if we look into the more
bulky parts of nature, we see the seas, lakes, and rivers teeming
with numberless kinds of living creatures; we find every mountain
and marsh, wilderness and wood plentifully stocked with birds and
beasts, and every part of matter affording proper necessaries and
conveniences for the livelihood of multitudes which, inhabit
it.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> The author of the <i>Plurality of Worlds</i> draws a
very good argument from this consideration, for the <i>peopling</i>
of every planet: as indeed it seems very probable, from the analogy
of reason, that if no part of matter, which we are acquainted with,
lies waste and useless, those great bodies; which are at such a
distance from us, should not be desert and unpeopled, but rather
that they should be furnished with beings adapted to their
respective situations.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> Existence is a blessing to those beings only which are
endowed with perception, and is in a manner thrown away upon dead
matter, any further than it is subservient to beings which are
conscious of their existence. Accordingly we find, from the bodies
which lie under our observation, that matter is only made as the
basis and support of animals, and that there is no more of the one,
than what is necessary for the existence of the other.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> Infinite goodness is of so communicative a nature,
that it seems to delight in the conferring of existence upon every
degree of perceptive being. As this is a speculation, which I have
often pursued with great pleasure to myself, I shall enlarge
further upon it, by considering that part of the scale of beings
which comes within our knowledge.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> There are some living creatures which are raised but
just above dead matter. To mention only that species of shell-fish,
which are formed in the fashion of a cone, that grow to the surface
of several rocks and immediately die upon their being severed from
the place where they grow: there are many other creatures but one
remove from these, which have no other sense besides that of
feeling and taste. Others have still an additional one of hearing;
others of smell; and others of sight.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> It is wonderful, to observe, by what a gradual
progress the world of life advances through a prodigious variety of
species, before a creature is formed that is complete in all its
senses: and even among these there is such a different degree of
perfection in the sense which one animal enjoys beyond what appears
in another, though the sense in different animals is distinguished
by the same common denomination; it seems almost of a different
nature.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> The exuberant and overflowing; goodness of the
Supreme Being, whose mercy extends to all his works, is plainly
seen, as I have before hinted; from his having made so very little
matter, at least what fall within our knowledge, that does not
swarm with life: nor is his goodness less seen in the diversity,
than in the multitude of living creatures. Had he only made one
species animals, none of the rest could have enjoyed the happiness
of existence; he has therefore <i>specified</i> in his creation
every degree of life, every capacity of being.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> The whole chasm of nature, from a plant to a man, is
filled up with divers kinds of creatures, rising one over another,
by such a gentle and easy ascent, that the little transitions and
deviations from one species to another, are almost insensible. This
intermediate space is so well husbanded and managed, that there is
scarce a degree of perception which does not appear in some one
part of the world of life. Is the goodness, or wisdom, of the
Divine Being, more manifested in this his proceeding?</p>
<p><b>12.</b> There is a consequence, besides those I have already
mentioned, which seems very naturally deducible from the foregoing
considerations. If the scale of being rises by such a regular
progress, so high as man, we may by a parity of reason suppose that
it still proceeds gradually through those beings which are of a
superior nature to him; since there is an infinitely greater space
and room for different degrees of perfection between the Supreme
Being and man, than between man and the most despicable insect.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> The consequence of so great a variety of beings which
are superior to us, from that variety which is inferior to us is
made by Mr. <i>Locke</i>, in a passage which I shall here set down,
after having premised that notwithstanding there is still infinite
room between man and his Maker for the creative power to exert
itself in, it is impossible that it should ever be filled up, since
there will be still an infinite gap or distance between the highest
created being, and the power which produced him.</p>
<p><b>14.</b> <i>That there should be more</i> species <i>of
intelligent creatures above us, than there are of sensible and
material below us, is probable to me from hence; that in all the
visible corporeal world, we see no chasms or no gaps. All quite
down from us, the descent is by easy steps, and a continued series
of things that in each remove, differ very little one from the
other. There are fishes that have wings, and are not strangers to
the airy region; and there are some birds, that are inhabitants of
the water, whose blood is as cold as fishes, and their flesh so
like in taste, that the scrupulous, are allowed them on
fish-days</i>.</p>
<p><b>15.</b> <i>There are animals so near of kin both to birds and
beasts, that they are in the middle between both; amphibious
animals, link the terrestrial and aquatic together: seals live on
land and at sea, and porpoises have the warm blood and entrails of
a hog. Not to mention what is confidently reported of mermaids or
sea-men, them are same brutes, that seem to have as much knowledge
and reason, as some that are called men; and the animal and
vegetable kingdoms are so nearly joined, that if you will take the
lowest of one, and the highest of the other, there will scarce be
perceived any great difference between them; and so on till we come
to the lowest and the most most inorganical parts of matter, we
shall find every where that the several</i> species <i>are linked
together, and differ but, in almost insensible degrees</i>.</p>
<p><b>16.</b> <i>And when we consider the infinite power and wisdom
of the Maker, we have reason to think that it is suitable to the
magnificent harmony of the universe, that the great design and
infinite goodness of the architect, that the</i> species <i>of
creatures should also, by gentle degrees, ascend upwards from us
toward his infinite perfection as we see they gradually descend
from us downward: which if it be probable, we have reason then to
be persuaded; that there are far more</i> species <i>of creatures
above us than there are beneath; we being in degrees of perfection
much more remote from the infinite Being of God, than we are from
the lowest state of being, and that which approaches nearest to
nothing. And yet of all those distinct species, we have no clear
distinct ideas.</i></p>
<p><b>17.</b> In this system of being, there is no creature so
wonderful in its nature, and which so much deserves our particular
attention, as man, who fills up the middle space between the animal
and intellectual nature, the visible and invisible world, and is
that link in the chain of being, which has been often termed the
<i>Nexus utriusque mundi</i>. So that he who in one respect is
associated with angels and archangels, may look upon a Being of
infinite perfection as his father, and the highest order of spirits
as his brethren; may in another respect say to <i>corruption, Thou
art my father, and to the worm, thou art my mother and my
sister</i>.</p>

120.</div>
<p><b>1.</b> I must confess I am infinitely delighted with those
speculations of nature which are to be made in a country-life; and
as my reading has very much lain among books of natural history, I
cannot forbear recollecting, upon this occasion, the several
remarks which I have met with in authors, and comparing them with
what falls under my own observation; the arguments for Providence
drawn from the natural history of animals, being, in my opinion,
demonstrative.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> The make of every kind of animal is different from
that of every other kind; and there is not the least turn in the
muscles or twist in the fibres of any one, which does not render
them more proper for that particular animal's way of life, than any
other cast or texture of them would have been.</p>
<p>The most violent appetites in all creatures are <i>lust</i> and
<i>hunger</i>; the first is a perpetual call upon them to propagate
their kind; the latter to preserve themselves.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> It is astonishing to consider the different degrees of
care that descend from the parent to the young, so far as is
absolutely necessary for the leaving a posterity. Some creatures
cast their eggs as chance directs them, and think of them no
further, as insects, and several kinds of fish; others, of a nicer
frame, find out proper beds to deposit them in, and there leave
them, as the serpent, the crocodile, and ostrich; others hatch
their eggs and tend the birth till it is able to shift for
itself.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> What can we call the principle which directs every
different kind of bird to observe a particular plan in the
structure of the nest, and directs all of the same species to work
after the same model! It cannot be <i>imitation</i>; for though you
hatch a crow under a hen, and never let it see any of the works of
its own kind, the nest it makes shall be the same to the laying of
a stick, with all the other nests of the same species. It cannot be
<i>reason</i>; for were animals endued with it to as great a degree
as man, their buildings would be as different as ours, according to
the different conveniences that they would propose to
themselves.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> Is it not remarkable, that the same temper of weather,
which raises this general warmth in animals, should cover the trees
with leaves, and the fields with grass, for their security and
concealment, and produce such infinite swarms of insects for the
support and sustenance of their respective broods?</p>
<p>Is it not wonderful that the love of the parent should be so
violent while it lasts, and that it should last no longer than is
necessary for the preservation of the young?</p>
<p><b>6.</b> With what caution does the hen provide herself a nest
in places unfrequented, and free from noise and disturbances? When
she has laid her eggs in such a manner that she can cover them,
what care does she take in turning them frequently, that all parts
may partake of the vital warmth? When she leaves them, to provide
for her necessary sustenance, how punctually does she return before
they have time to cool, and become incapable of producing an
animal? In the summer, you see her giving herself greater freedoms,
and quitting her care for above two hours together; but, in winter,
when the rigour of the season would chill the principles of life,
and destroy the young one, she grows more assiduous in her
attendance, and stays away but half the time.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> When the birth approaches, with how much nicety and
attention does she help the chick to break its prison? Not to take
notice of her covering it from the injuries of the weather,
providing it proper nourishment, and teaching it to help itself;
nor to mention her forsaking the nest, if after the usual time of
reckoning the young one does not make its appearance. A chymical
operation could not be followed with greater art or diligence, than
is seen in the hatching of a chick; though there are many more
birds that show an infinitely greater sagacity in all the fore
mentioned particulars.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> But at the same time the hen, that has all this
seeming ingenuity (which is indeed absolutely necessary for the
propagation of the species) considered in other respects, is
without the least glimmerings of thought or common sense. She
mistakes a piece of chalk for an egg, and sits upon it in the same
manner: she is insensible of any increase or diminution in the
number of those she lays: she does not distinguish between her own
and those off another species; and when the birth appears of ever
so different a bird, will cherish it for her own. In all these
circumstances, which do not carry an immediate regard to the
subsistence of herself or her species, she is a very idiot.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> There is not, in my opinion, any thing more mysterious
in nature than this instinct in animals, which thus, rises above
reason, and falls infinitely short of it. It cannot be accounted
for by any properties of matter, and at the same time works after
so odd a manner, that one cannot think it the faculty of an
intellectual being. For my own part, I look upon it as upon the
principle of gravitation in bodies, which is not to be explained by
any known qualities inherent in the bodies themselves, nor from any
laws in mechanism; but, according to the best notions of the
greatest philosophers, is an immediate impression from the first
mover, and the divine energy acting in the creature.</p>

<a name='Good_Breeding' id="Good_Breeding"></a>
<h2><i>Good-Breeding.</i></h2>
<p><b>1.</b> Complaisance renders a superior amiable, an equal
agreeable, and an inferior acceptable. It smoothes distinction,
sweetens conversation, and makes every one in the company pleased
with himself. It produces good nature and mutual benevolence,
encourages the timorous, soothes the turbulent; humanizes the
fierce, and distinguishes a society of civilized persons from a
confusion of savages. In a word, complaisance is a virtue that
blends all orders of men together in a friendly intercourse of
words and actions, and is suited to that equality in human nature
which every one ought to consider, so far as is consistent with the
order and economy of the world.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> If we could look into the secret anguish and
affliction of every man's heart, we should often find, that more of
it arises from little imaginary distresses, such as checks, frowns,
contradictions, expressions of contempt, and (what
<i>Shakspeare</i> reckons among other evils under the sun)</p>
<div class='blkquot'>
<p>"&mdash;The poor man's contumely, The insolence of office, and
the spurns That patient merit of the unworthy takes,"</p>
</div>
<p>than from the more real pains and calamities of life. The only
method to remove these imaginary distresses as much as possible out
of human life, would be the universal practice of such an ingenious
complaisance as I have been here describing, which, as it is a
virtue, may be defined to be a "constant endeavour to please those
whom we converse with, so far as we may do it innocently."</p>
<p><b>3.</b> Good-breeding necessarily implies civility; but
civility does not reciprocally imply good-breeding. The former has
its intrinsic weight and value, which the latter always adorns, and
often doubles by its workmanship.</p>
<p>To sacrifice one's own self-love to other people's, is a short,
but, I believe, a true definition of civility: to do it with ease,
propriety and grace, is good-breeding. The one is the result of
good-nature; the other of good-sense, joined to experience,
observation and attention.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> A ploughman will be civil, if he is good-natured, but
cannot be well bred. A courtier will be well bred though perhaps
without good-nature, if he has but good sense. Flattery is the
disgrace of good-breeding, as brutality often is of truth and
sincerity. Good-breeding is the middle point between those two
odious extremes.</p>
<p>Ceremony is the superstition of good-breeding, as well as of
religion: but yet, being an out-work to both, should not be
absolutely demolished. It is always, to a certain degree, to be
complied with, though despised by those who think, because admired
and respected by those who do not.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> The most perfect degree of good-breeding, as I have
already hinted, is only to be acquired by great knowledge of the
world, and keeping the best company. It is not the object of mere
speculation, and cannot be exactly defined, as it consists in a
fitness, a propriety of words, actions, and even looks, adapted to
the infinite variety and combinations of persons, places, and
things. It is a mode, not a substance; for what is good-breeding at
St. <i>James's</i>, would pass for foppery or banter in a remote
village; and the homespun civility of that village would be
considered as brutality at court.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> A cloistered pedant may form true notions of civility;
but if amidst the cobwebs of his cell he pretends to spin a
speculative system of good-breeding, he will not be less absurd
than his predecessor, who judiciously undertook to instruct
<i>Hannibal</i>, in the art of war. The most ridiculous and most
aukward of men are, therefore, the speculatively well bred monks of
all religions and all professions.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> Good-breeding, like charity, not only covers a
multitude of faults, but, to a certain degree, supplies the want of
some virtues. In the common intercourse of life, it nets
good-nature, and often does what good-nature will not always do; it
keeps both wits and fools within those bounds of decency, which the
former are too apt to transgress, and which the latter never know.
Courts are unquestionably the seats of good-breeding and must
necessarily be so; otherwise they would be the seats of violence
and desolation. There all the passions are in their highest state
of fermentation.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> All pursue what but few can obtain, and many seek what
but one can enjoy. Good-breeding alone restrains their excesses.
There, if enemies did not embrace they would stab. There, smiles
are often put on to conceal tears. There, mutual services are
professed, while mutual injuries are intended; and there, the guile
of the serpent stimulates the gentleness of the dove: all this, it
is true, at the expense of sincerity; but upon the whole, to the
advantage of social intercourse in general.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> I would not be misapprehended, and supposed to
recommend good-breeding, thus prophaned and prostituted to the
purposes of guilt and perfidy; but I think I may justly infer from
it, to what a degree the accomplishment of good-breeding must adorn
and enforce virtue and truth, when it can thus soften the outrages
and deformity of vice and falsehood. I am sorry to be obliged to
confess, that my native country is not perhaps the seat of the most
perfect good-breeding, though I really believe, that it yields to
none in hearty and sincere civility, as far as civility is (and to
a certain degree it is) an inferior moral duty of doing as one
would be done by.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> If <i>France</i> exceeds us in that particular, the
incomparable author of <i>L'Esprit des Loix</i> accounts for it
very impartially, and I believe very truly. "If my countrymen,"
says he, "are the best bred people in the world, it is only because
they are the vainest." It is certain that their good-breeding and
attention, by flattering the vanity and self-love of others, repay
their own with interest. It is a general commerce, usefully carried
on by a barter of attentions, and often without one grain of solid
merit, by way of medium, to make up the balance.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> It were to be wished that good-breeding were in
general thought a more essential part in the education of our
youth, especially of distinction, than at present it seems to be.
It might even be substituted in the room of some academical
studies, that take up a great deal of time to very little purpose;
or, at least, it might usefully share some of those many hours,
that are so frequently employed upon a coach-box, or in stables.
Surely those, who by their rank and fortune are called to adorn
courts, ought at least not to disgrace, them by their manners.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> But I observe with concern, that it is the fashion
for our youth of both sexes to brand good-breeding with the name of
ceremony and formality. As such they ridicule and explode it, and
adopt in its stead, an offensive carelessness and inattention, to
the diminution, I will venture to say, even of their own pleasures,
if they know what true pleasures are. Love and friendship
necessarily produce, and justly authorize familiarity; but then
good-breeding must mark out its bounds, and say, thus far shalt
thou go, and no farther; for I have known many a passion and many a
friendship, degraded, weakened, and at last (if I may use the
expression) wholly flattened away, by an unguarded and illiberal
familiarity.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> Nor is good-breeding less the ornament and cement of
common social life: it connects, it endears, and at the same time
that it indulges the just liberty, restrains that indecent
licentiousness of conversation, which alienates and provokes. Great
talents make a man famous, great merit makes him respected, and
great learning makes him esteemed; but good breeding alone can make
him beloved.</p>
<p><b>14.</b> I recommend it in a more particular manner to my
countrywomen, as the greatest ornament to such of them as have
beauty, and the safest refuge for those who have not. It
facilitates the victories, decorates the triumphs, and secures the
conquests of beauty; or in some degree atones for the want of it.
It almost deifies a fine woman, and procures respect at least to
those who have not charms enough to be admired. Upon the whole,
though good-breeding cannot, strictly speaking, be called a virtue,
yet it is productive of so many good effects, that, in my opinion,
it may be justly reckoned more than a mere accomplishment.</p>

<a name='Further_Remarks_taken_from_Lord_Chesterfields_Letters' id=
"Further_Remarks_taken_from_Lord_Chesterfields_Letters"></a>
<h2><i>Further Remarks, taken from Lord Chesterfield's Letters to
his Son.</i></h2>
<p><b>15.</b> Good-Breeding has been very justly defined to be "the
result of much good-sense, some good nature and a little
self-denial for the sake of others, and with a view to obtain the
same indulgence from them."</p>
<p>Good-breeding alone can prepossess people in our favour at first
sight; more time being necessary to discover greater talents.
Good-breeding, however, does not consist in low bows, and formal
ceremony; but in an easy civil, and respectful behaviour.</p>
<p><b>16.</b> Indeed, good-sense, in many cases, must determine
good-breeding; for what would be civil at one time, and to one
person, would be rude at another time, and to another person: there
are, however, some general rules of good-breeding. As for example;
to answer only yes, or no, to any person, without adding sir, my
lord, or madam, (as it may happen) is always extremely rude; and it
is equally so not to give proper attention and a civil answer, when
spoken to: such behaviour convinces the person who is speaking to
us, that we despise him, and do not think him worthy of our
attention or answer.</p>
<p><b>17.</b> A well-bred person will take care to answer with
complaisance when he is spoken to; will place himself at the lower
end of the table, unless bid to go higher; will first drink to the
lady of the house, and then to the master; he will not eat
aukwardly or dirtily, nor sit when others stand; and he will do all
this with an air of complaisance, and not with a grave ill-natured
look, as if he did it all unwillingly.</p>
<p><b>18.</b> There is nothing more difficult to attain, or so
necessary to possess, as perfect good-breeding; which is equally
inconsistent with a stiff formality, an impertinent forwardness,
and an aukward bashfulness. A little ceremony is sometimes
necessary; a certain degree of firmness is absolutely so; and an
outward modesty is extremely becoming.</p>
<p><b>19.</b> Virtue and learning, like gold, have their intrinsic
value; but, if they are not polished, they certainly lose a great
deal of their lustre: and even polished brass will pass upon more
people than rough gold. What a number of sins does the cheerful,
easy, good-breeding of the <i>French</i> frequently cover!</p>
<p>My Lord <i>Bacon</i> says, that "a pleasing figure is a
perpetual letter of recommendation." It is certainly an agreeable
fore-runner of merit and smooths the way for it.</p>
<p><b>20.</b> A man of good-breeding should be acquainted with the
forms and particular customs of courts. At <i>Vienna</i> men always
make courtesies, instead of bows, to the emperor; in <i>France</i>
nobody bows to the king, or kisses his hand; but in <i>Spain</i>
and <i>England</i> bows are made and hands are kissed. Thus every
court has some peculiarity, which those who visit them ought
previously to inform themselves of, to avoid blunders and
aukwardness.</p>
<p><b>21.</b> Very few, scarce any, are wanting in the respect
which they should shew to those whom they acknowledge to be
infinitely their superiors. The man of fashion, and of the world,
expresses it in its fullest extent; but naturally, easily, and
without concern: whereas a man, who is not used to keep good
company, expresses it aukwardly; one sees that he is not used to
it, and that it costs him a great deal: but I never saw the worst
bred man living, guilty of lolling, whistling, scratching his head,
and such-like indecencies, in company that he respected. In such
companies, therefore, the only point to be attended to is, to shew
that respect, which every body means to shew, in an easy,
unembarrassed and graceful manner.</p>
<p><b>22.</b> In mixed companies, whoever is admitted to make part
of them, is, for the time at least, supposed to be upon a footing
of equality with the rest; and consequently, every one claims, and
very justly, every mark of civility and good-breeding. Ease is
allowed, but carelessness and negligence are strictly forbidden. If
a man accosts you, and talks to you ever so dully or frivolously,
it is worse than rudeness, it is brutality, to shew him, by a
manifest inattention to what he says, that you think him a fool or
a blockhead, and not worth hearing.</p>
<p><b>23.</b> It is much more so with regard to women; who, of
whatever rank they are, are entitled, in consideration of their
sex, not only to an attentive, but an officious good-breeding from
men. Their little wants, likings, dislikes, preferences,
antipathies, fancies, whims, and even impertinences, must be
officiously attended to, flattered, and, if possible, guessed at
and anticipated, by a well-bred man. You must never usurp to
yourself those conveniences and <i>agr&eacute;mens</i> which are of
common right; such as the best places, the best dishes, &amp;c.
but, on the contrary, always decline themself yourself, and offer
them to others; who, in their turns, will offer them to you: so
that, upon the whole, you will, in your turn, enjoy your share of
common right.</p>
<p><b>24.</b> The third sort of good-breeding is local; and is
variously modified, in not only different countries, but in
different towns in the same country. But it must be founded upon
the two former sorts: they are the matter; to which, in this case,
fashion and custom only give the different shapes and impressions.
Whoever has the two first sorts, will easily acquire this third
sort of good-breeding, which depends singly upon attention and
observation. It is properly the polish, the lustre, the last
finishing strokes of good-breeding. A man of sense, therefore,
carefully attends to the local manners of the respective places
where he is, and takes for his models those persons, whom he
observes to be at the head of the fashion and good-breeding.</p>
<p><b>25.</b> He watches how they address themselves to their
superiors, how they accost their equals, and how they treat their
inferiors: and lets none of those little niceties escape him; which
are to good-breeding, what the last delicate and masterly touches
are to a good picture, and which the vulgar have no notion of, but
by which good judges distinguish the master. He attends even to
their airs, dress, and motions, and imitates them liberally, and
not servilely; he copies, but does not mimic. These personal graces
are of very great consequence. They anticipate the sentiments,
before merit can engage the understanding: they captivate the
heart, and give rise, I believe, to the extravagant notions of
charms and philtres. Their effects were so surprising, that they
were reckoned supernatural.</p>
<p><b>26.</b> In short, as it is necessary to possess learning,
honor and virtue, to gain the esteem and admiration of mankind, so
politeness and good-breeding are equally necessary to render us
agreeable in conversation and common life. Great talents are above
the generality of the world; who neither possess them themselves,
nor are competent judges of them in others; but all are judges of
the lesser talents, such, as civility, affability, and an agreeable
address and manner; because they feel the good effects of them, as
making society easy and agreeable.</p>
<p>To conclude: be assured that the profoundest learning, without
good-breeding, is unwelcome and tiresome pedantry; that a man who
is not perfectly well-bred, is unfit for company, and unwelcome in
it; and that a man, who is not well-bred, is full as unfit for
business as for company.</p>
<p>Make, then, good-breeding the great object of your thoughts and
actions. Observe carefully the behaviour and manners of those who
are distinguished by their good-breeding; imitate, nay, endeavour
to excel, that you may at least reach them; and be convinced that
good-breeding is to all worldly qualifications, what charity is to
all christian virtues. Observe how it adorns merit, and how often
it covers the want of it.</p>
<br>
<br>
<a name='Genteel_Carriage' id="Genteel_Carriage"></a>
<h2><i>Genteel Carriage.</i></h2>
<p><b>1.</b> Next to good-breeding is a genteel manner and
carriage, wholly free from those ill habits and aukward actions,
which many very worthy persons are addicted to.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> A genteel manner of behaviour, how trifling soever it
may seem, is of the utmost consequence in private life. Men of very
inferior parts have been esteemed, merely for their genteel
carriage and good-breeding, while sensible men have given disgust
for want of it. There is something or other that prepossesses us at
first sight in favor of a well-bred man, and makes us wish to like
him.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> When an aukward fellow first comes into a room, he
attempts to bow, and his sword, if he wears one, gets between his
legs, and nearly throws him down. Confused, and ashamed, he
stumbles to the upper end of the room and seats himself in the very
chair he should not. He there begins playing with his hat, which he
presently drops; and recovering his hat, he lets fall his cane; and
in picking up his cane, down goes his hat again: thus 'tis a
considerable time before he is adjusted.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> When his tea or coffee is handed to him, he spreads
his handkerchief upon his knee, scalds his mouth, drops either the
cup or the saucer, and spills the tea or coffee in his lap. At
dinner he is more uncommonly aukward: there he tucks his napkin
through a button-hole, which tickles his chin, and occasions him to
make a variety of wry faces; he seats himself on the edge of the
chair, at so great a distance from the table, that he frequently
drops his meat between his plate and his mouth; he holds his knife,
fork and spoon different from other people; eats with his knife, to
the manifest danger of his mouth; picks his teeth with his fork,
rakes his mouth with his finger, and puts his spoon, which has been
in his throat a dozen times, into the dish again.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> If he is to carve he cannot hit the joint, but in
labouring to cut through the bone, splashes the sauce over every
body's clothes. He generally daubs himself all over, his elbows are
in the next person's plate, and he is up to the knuckles in soup
and grease. If he drinks, it is with his mouth full, interrupting
the whole company with, "to your good health, Sir," and "my service
to you;" perhaps coughs in his glass, and besprinkles the whole
table. Further, he has perhaps a number of disagreeable tricks; he
snuffs up his nose, picks it with his fingers, blows it; and looks
in his handkerchief, crams his hands first in his bosom, and next
in his breeches.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> In short, he neither dresses nor acts like any other
but is particularly aukward in every thing he does. All this, I
own, has nothing in it criminal; but it is such an offence to good
manners and good-breeding that it is universally despised; it makes
a man ridiculous in every company, and, of course, ought carefully
to be avoided by every one who would wish to please.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> From this picture of the ill-bred man, you will easily
discover that of the well-bred; for you may readily judge what you
ought to do, when you are told what you ought not to do; a little
attention to the manners of those who have seen the world, will
make a proper behaviour habitual and familiar to you.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> Actions, that would otherwise be pleasing, frequently
become ridiculous by your manner of doing-them. If a lady drops her
fan in company, the worst bred man would immediately pick it up,
and give it to her; the best bred man can do no more; but then he
does it in a graceful manner, which is sure to please; whereas the
other would do it so aukwardly as to be laughed at.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> You may also know a well-bred person by his manner of
sitting. Ashamed and confused, the aukward man sits in his chair
stiff and bolt upright, whereas the man of fashion is easy in every
position; instead of lolling or lounging as he sits, he leans with
elegance, and by varying his attitudes, shews that he has been used
to good company. Let it be one part of your study, then, to learn
to set genteely in different companies, to loll gracefully, where
you are authorised to take that liberty, and to set up
respectfully, where that freedom is not allowable.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> In short, you cannot conceive how advantageous a
graceful carriage and a pleasing address are, upon all occasions;
they ensnare the affections, steal a prepossession in our favour,
and play about the heart till they engage it.</p>
<p>Now to acquire a graceful air, you must attend to your dancing;
no one can either sit, stand, or walk well unless he dances well.
And in learning to dance be particularly attentive to the motion of
your arms, for a stiffness in the wrist will make any man look
aukward. If a man walks well, presents himself well in company,
wears his hat well, moves his head properly and his arms
gracefully, it is almost all that is necessary.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> There is also an aukwardness in speech, that
naturally falls under this head, and ought to, and may be guarded
against; such as forgetting names and mistaking one name for
another; to speak of Mr. What-d'ye-call him, or, You-know-who, Mrs.
Thingum, What's-her-name, or, How-d'ye-call her, is exceedingly
aukward and vulgar. 'Tis the same to address people by improper
titles, as <i>sir</i> for <i>my lord</i>; to begin a story without
being able to finish it, and break off in the middle, with "I have
forgot the rest."</p>
<p><b>12.</b> Our voice and manner of speaking, too, should
likewise be attended to. Some will mumble over their words, so as
not to be intelligible, and others will speak so fast as not to be
understood, and in doing this, will sputter and spit in your face;
some will bawl as if they were speaking to the deaf: others will
speak so low as scarcely to be heard; and many will put their faces
so close to your's as to offend you with their breath.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> All these habits are horrid and disgustful, but may
easily be got the better of with care. They are the vulgar
characteristics of a low-bred man, or are proofs that very little
pains have been bestowed in his education. In short, an attention
to these little matters is of greater importance than you are aware
of; many a sensible man having lost ground for want of these little
graces, and many a one possessed of these perfections alone, having
made his way through life, that otherwise would not have been
noticed.</p>
<br>
<a name='Cleanliness_of_Person' id="Cleanliness_of_Person"></a>
<h2><i>Cleanliness of Person.</i></h2>
<p><b>14.</b> But as no one can please in company, however graceful
his air, unless he be clean and neat in his person, this
qualification comes next to be considered.</p>
<p><b>15.</b> Negligence of one's person not only implies an
unsufferable indolence, but an indifference whether we please or
not. In others, it betrays an insolence and affectation, arising
from a presumption that they are sure of pleasing, without having
recourse to those means by which many are obliged to use.</p>
<p><b>16.</b> He who is not thoroughly clean in his person, will be
offensive to all he converses with. A particular regard to the
cleanness of your mouth, teeth, hands and nails, is but common
decency. A foul mouth and unclean hands are certain marks of
vulgarity; the first is the cause of an offensive breath, which
nobody can bear, and the last is declaratory of dirty work; one may
always know a gentleman by the state of his hands and nails. The
flesh at the roots should be kept back, so as to shew the
semicircles at the bottom of the nails; the edges of the nails
should never be cut down below the ends of the fingers; nor should
they be suffered to grow longer than the fingers.</p>
<p><b>17.</b> When the nails are cut down to the quick, it is a
shrewd sign that the man is a mechanic, to whom long nails would be
troublesome, or that he gets his bread by fiddling; and if they are
longer than his fingers ends, and encircled with a black rim, it
foretells he has been laboriously and meanly employed, and too
fatigued to clean himself: a good apology for want of cleanliness
in a mechanic, but the greatest disgrace that can attend a
gentleman.</p>
<p><b>18.</b> These things may appear too significant to be
mentioned; but when it is considered that a thousand little
nameless things, which every one feels but no one can describe,
conspire to form that <i>whole</i> of pleasing, I hope you will not
call them trifling. Besides a clean shirt and a clean person are as
necessary to health, as not to offend other people. It is a maxim
with me, which I have lived to see verified, that he who is
negligent at twenty years of age, will be a sloven at forty, and
intolerable at fifty.</p>
<br>
<a name='Dress' id="Dress"></a>
<h2><i>Dress</i>.</h2>
<p><b>19.</b> Neatness of person I observed was as necessary as
cleanliness; of course some attention must be paid to your
dress.</p>
<p>Such is the absurdity of the times, that to pass well with the
world, we must adopt some of its customs, be they ridiculous or
not.</p>
<p><b>20.</b> In the first place, to neglect one's dress is to
affront all the female part of our acquaintance. The women in
particular pay an attention to their dress; to neglect, therefore,
your's, will displease them, as it would be tacitly taxing them
with vanity, and declaring that you thought them not worth the
respect which every body else does. And, as I have mentioned
before, as it is the women who stamp a young man's credit in the
fashionable world, if you do not make yourself agreeable to the
women, you will assuredly lose ground among the men.</p>
<p><b>21.</b> Dress, as trifling as it may appear to a man of
understanding, prepossesses on the first appearance, which is
frequently decisive; and indeed we may form some opinion of a man's
sense and character from his dress. Any exceeding of the fashion,
or any affectation in dress whatever, argues a weakness of
understanding, and nine times out of ten it will be found so.</p>
<p><b>22.</b> There are few young fellows but what display some
character or other in this shape. Some would be thought fearless
and brave: these wear a black cravat, a short coat and waistcoat,
an uncommon long sword hanging to their knees, a large hat fiercely
cocked, and are <i>flash</i> all over. Others affect to be country
squires; these will go about in buckskin breeches, brawn frocks,
and great oaken cudgels in their hands, slouched hats, with their
hair undressed and tucked up behind them to an enormous size, and
imitate grooms and country boobies so well externally, that there
is not the least doubt of their resembling them as well
internally.</p>
<p><b>23.</b> Others, again, paint and powder themselves so much,
and dress so finically, as leads us to suppose they are only women
in boy's clothes. Now a sensible man carefully avoids all this, or
any other affectation. He dresses as fashionable and well as
persons of the best families and best sense; if he exceeds them, he
is a coxcomb; if he dresses worse, he is unpardonable.</p>
<p><b>24.</b> Dress yourself fine, then, if possible, or plain,
agreeable to the company you are in; that is, conform to the dress
of others, and avoid the appearance of being tumbled. Imitate those
reasonable people of your own age, whose dress is neither remarked
as too neglected or too much studied. Take care to have your
clothes well made, in the fashion, and to fit you, or you will,
after all, appear aukward. When once dressed, think no more of it;
shew no fear of discomposing your dress, but let all your motions
be as easy and unembarrassed, as if you was at home in your
dishabille.</p>
<br>
<a name='Elegance_of_Expression' id="Elegance_of_Expression"></a>
<h2><i>Elegance of Expression.</i></h2>
<p><b>25.</b> Having mentioned elegance of person, I will proceed
to elegance of expression.</p>
<p>It is not one or two qualifications alone that will complete the
gentleman; it must be an union of many; and graceful speaking is as
essential as gracefulness of person. Every man cannot be an
harmonious speaker; a roughness or coarseness of voice may prevent
it; but if there are no natural imperfections, if a man does not
stammer or lisp, or has not lost his teeth, he may speak
gracefully; nor will all these defects, if he has a mind to it,
prevent him from speaking correctly.</p>
<p><b>26.</b> Nobody can attend with pleasure to a bad speaker. One
who tells his story ill, be it ever so important, will tire even
the most patient. If you have been present at the performance of a
good tragedy, you have doubtless been sensible of the good effects
of a speech well delivered; how much it has interested and affected
you; and on the contrary, how much an ill-spoken one has disgusted
you.</p>
<p><b>37.</b> 'Tis the same in common conversation; he who speaks
deliberately, distinctly and correctly; he who makes use of the
best words to express himself, and varies his voice according to
the nature of the subject, will always please, while the thick or
hasty speaker, he who mumbles out a set of ill-chosen words, utters
them ungrammatically, or with a dull monotony, will tire and
disgust. Be assured then, the air, the gesture, the looks of a
speaker, a proper accent, a just emphasis, and tuneful cadence, are
full as necessary, to please and to be attended to, as the subject
matter itself.</p>
<p><b>28.</b> People may talk what they will of solid reasoning and
sound sense; without the graces and ornaments of language, they
will neither please nor persuade. In common discourse, even trifles
elegantly expressed, will be better received, than the best of
arguments homespun and unadorned.</p>
<p><b>29.</b> A good way to acquire a graceful utterance, is to
read aloud to some friend every day, and beg of him to set you
right, in case you read too fast, do not observe the proper stops,
lay wrong emphasis, or utter your words indistinctly. You may even
read aloud to yourself where such a friend is not at hand, and you
will find your own ear a good corrector. Take care to open your
teeth when you read or speak, and articulate every word distinctly;
which last cannot be done but by sounding the final letter. But
above all, endeavour to vary your voice according to the matter,
and avoid a monotony. By a daily attention to this, it will in a
little time become easy and habitual to you.</p>
<p><b>30.</b> Pay an attention also to your looks and your gesture,
when talking even on the most trifling subjects: things appear very
different according as they are expressed, looked and
delivered.</p>
<p>Now, if it is necessary to attend so particularly to our
<i>manner</i> of speaking, it is much more so with regard to the
<i>matter</i>. Fine turns of expression, a genteel and correct
style, are ornaments as requisite to common sense, as polite
behaviour and an elegant address are to common good manners; they
are great assistants in the point of pleasing. A gentleman, 'tis
true, may be known in the meanest garb, but it admits not of a
doubt, that he would be better received into good company genteely
and fashionably dressed, than was he to appear in dirt and
tatters.</p>
<p><b>31.</b> Be careful, then, of your style upon all occasions;
whether you write or speak, study for the best words and best
expressions, even in common conversation and the most familiar
letters. This will prevent your speaking in a hurry, than which
nothing is more vulgar; though you may be a little embarrassed at
first, time and use will render it easy. It is no such difficult
thing to express ourselves well on subjects we are thoroughly
acquainted with, if we think before we speak; and no one should
presume to do otherwise.</p>
<p><b>32.</b> When you have said a thing, if you did not reflect
before, be sure to do it after wards: consider with yourself
whether you could not have expressed yourself better; and if you
are in doubt of the propriety or elegancy of any word, search for
it in some dictionary, or some good author, while you remember it;
never be sparing of your trouble while you wish to improve, and my
word for it, a very little time will make this matter habitual.</p>
<p><b>33.</b> In order to speak grammatically, and to express
yourself pleasingly, I would recommend it to you to translate
often, any language you are acquainted with, into English, and to
correct such translation till the words, their order, and the
periods, are agreeable to your own ear.</p>
<p>Vulgarism in language is another distinguishing mark of bad
company and education. Expressions may be correct in themselves and
yet be vulgar, owing to their not being fashionable; for language
as manners are both established for the usage of people of
fashion.</p>
<p><b>34.</b> The conversation of a low-bred man is filled up with
proverbs and hackneyed sayings; instead of observing that tastes
are different, and that most men have one peculiar to themselves,
he will give you&mdash;"What is one man's meat is another man's
poison;" or, "Every one to their liking, as the old woman said,
when she kissed her cow." He has ever some favourite word, which he
lugs in upon all occasions, right or wrong; such as <i>vastly</i>
angry, <i>vastly</i> kind; <i>devilish</i> ugly, <i>devilish</i>
handsome; <i>immensely</i> great, <i>immensely</i> little.</p>
<p><b>35.</b> Even his pronunciation carries the mark of vulgarity
along with it; he calls the earth <i>yearth</i>; finan' ces,
<i>fin' ances</i>, he goes <i>to wards</i>, and not towards such a
place. He affects to use hard words, to give him the appearance of
a man of learning, but frequently mistakes their meaning, and
seldom, if ever, pronounces them properly.</p>
<p>All this must be avoided, if you would not be supposed to have
kept company with foot-men and house-maids. Never have recourse to
proverbial or vulgar sayings; use neither favourite nor hard words,
but seek for the most elegant; be careful in the management of
them, and depend on it your labour will not be lost; for nothing is
more engaging than a fashionable and polite address.</p>

<a name='Small_Talk' id="Small_Talk"></a>
<h2><i>Small-Talk</i>.</h2>
<p><b>36.</b> In all good company we meet with a certain manner,
phraseology and general conversation, that distinguishes the man of
fashion. This can only be acquired by frequenting good company, and
being particularly attentive to all that passes there.</p>
<p><b>37.</b> When invited to dine or sup at the house of any
well-bred man, observe how he does the honours of his table, and
mark his manner of treating his company.</p>
<p>Attend to the compliments of congratulation or condolence that
he pays; and take notice of his address to his superiors, his
equals, and his inferiors; nay, his very looks and tone of voice
are worth your attention, for we cannot please without an union of
them all.</p>
<p><b>38.</b> There is a certain distinguishing diction that marks
the man of fashion, a certain language of conversation that every
gentleman should be master of. Saying to a man just married, "I
wish you joy," or to one who has lost his wife, "I am sorry for
your loss," and both perhaps with an unmeaning countenance, may be
civil, but it is nevertheless vulgar. A man of fashion will express
the same thing more elegantly, and with a look of sincerity, that
shall attract the esteem of the person he speaks to. He will
advance to the one, with warmth and cheerfulness, and perhaps
squeezing him by the hand, will say, "Believe me, my dear sir, I
have scarce words to express the joy I feel, upon your happy
alliance with such or such a family, &amp;c." To the other in
affliction he will advance slowly, and with a peculiar composure of
voice and countenance, begin his compliments of condolence with, "I
hope, sir, you will do me the justice to be persuaded, that I am
not insensible of your unhappiness, that I take part in your
distress, and shall ever be affected where <i>you</i> are so."</p>
<p><b>39.</b> Your first address to, and indeed all your
conversation with your superiors, should be open, cheerful, and
respectful; with your equals, warm, and animated; with your
inferiors, hearty, free, and unreserved.</p>
<p><b>40.</b> There is a fashionable kind of small-talk, which,
however trifling it may be thought, has its use in mixed companies;
of course you should endeavour to acquire it. By small-talk, I mean
a good deal to say on unimportant matters: for example, foods, the
flavour and growth of wines, and the chit-chat of the day. Such
conversation will serve to keep off serious subjects, that might
some time create disputes. This chit-chat is chiefly to be learned
by frequenting the company of the ladies.</p>
<br>
<br>
<a name='Observation' id="Observation"></a>
<h2><i>Observation</i>.</h2>
<p><b>1.</b> As the art of pleasing is to be learnt only by
frequenting the best companies, we must endeavour to pick it up in
such companies, by observation; for, it is not sense and knowledge
alone that will acquire esteem; these certainly are the first and
necessary foundations for pleasing, but they will by no means do,
unless attended with manners and attention.</p>
<p>There have been people who have frequented the first companies
till their life-time, and yet have never got rid of their natural
stiffness and aukwardness; but have continued as vulgar as if they
were never out of a servant's hall: this has been owing to
carelessness, and a want of attention to the manners and behaviour
of others.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> There are a great many people likewise who busy
themselves the whole day, and who in fact do nothing. They have
possibly taken up a book for two or three hours, but from a certain
inattention that grows upon them the more it is indulged, know no
more of the contents than if they had not looked into it; nay, it
is impossible for any one to retain what he reads, unless he
reflects and reasons upon it as he goes on. When they have thus
lounged away an hour or two, they will saunter into company,
without attending to any thing that passes there; but, if they
think at all, are thinking of some trifling matter that ought not
to occupy their attention; thence perhaps they go to the play,
where they stare at the company and the lights, without attending
to the piece, the very thing they went to see.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> In this manner they wear away their hours, that might
otherwise he employed to their improvement and advantage. This
silly suspension of thought they would have pass <i>absence of
mind</i>&mdash;Ridiculous!&mdash;Wherever you are, let me recommend
it to you to pay attention to all that passes; observe the
characters of the persons you are with, and the subjects of their
conversation; listen to every thing that is said, see every thing
that is done, and (according to the vulgar saying) have your eyes
and your ears about you.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> A continual inattention to matters that occur, is the
characteristic of a weak mind; the man who gives way to it, is
little else than a trifler, a blank in society, which every
sensible person overlooks; surely what is worth doing is worth
doing well, and nothing can be done well if not properly attended
to. When I hear a man say, on being asked about any thing that was
said or done in his presence, "that truly he did not mind it," I am
ready to knock the fool down. <i>Why</i> did he not mind
it?&mdash;What had he else to do?&mdash;A man of sense and fashion
never makes use of this paltry plea; he never complains of a
treacherous memory, but attends to and remembers every thing that
is said or done.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> Whenever, then, you go into good company, that is, the
company of people of fashion, observe carefully their behaviour,
their address, and their manner; imitate it as far as in your
power. Your attention, if possible, should be so ready as to
observe every person in the room at once, their motions, their
looks, and their turns of expression, and that without staring or
seeming to be an observer. This kind of observation may be acquired
by care and practice, and will be found of the utmost advantage to
you, in the course of life.</p>
<br>
<br>
<a name='Absence_of_Mind' id="Absence_of_Mind"></a>
<h2><i>Absence of Mind</i>.</h2>
<p><b>1.</b> Having mentioned absence of mind, let me be more
particular concerning it.</p>
<p>What the world calls an absent man is generally either a very
affected one or a very weak one; but whether weak or affected, he
is, in company, a very disagreeable man. Lost in thought, or
possibly in no thought at all, he is a stranger to every one
present, and to every thing that passes; he knows not his best
friends, is deficient in every act of good manners, unobservant of
the actions of the company, and insensible to his own.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> His answers are quite the reverse of what they ought
to be; talk to him of one thing, he replies, as of another. He
forgets what he said last, leaves his hat in one room, his cane in
another, and his sword in a third; nay, if it was not for his
buckles, he would even leave his shoes behind him. Neither his arms
nor his legs seem to be a part of his body, and his head is never
in a right position. He joins not in the general conversation,
except it be by fits and starts, as if awaking from a dream; I
attribute this either to weakness or affectation.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> His shallow mind is possibly not able to attend to
more than one thing at a time, or he would be supposed wrapt up in
the investigation of some very important matter. Such men as Sir
<i>Isaac Newton</i> or Mr. <i>Locke</i>, might occasionally have
some excuse for absence of mind; it might proceed from that
intenseness of thought that was necessary at all times for the
scientific subjects they were studying; but, for a young man, and a
man of the world, who has no such plea to make, absence of mind is
a rudeness to the company, and deserves the severest censure.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> However insignificant a company may be; however
trifling their conversation; while you are with them, do not shew
them by any inattention that you think them trifling; that can
never be the way to please; but rather fall in with their weakness
than otherwise, for to mortify, or shew the least contempt to those
we are in company with, is the greatest rudeness we can be guilty
of; and what few can forgive.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> I never yet found a man inattentive to the person he
feared, or the woman he loved; which convinces me that absence of
mind is to be got the better of, if we think proper to make the
trial; and believe me, it is always worth the attempt.</p>
<p>Absence of mind is a tacit declaration, that those we are in
company with are not worth attending to; and what can be a greater
affront?&mdash;Besides, can an absent man improve by what is said
or done in his presence?&mdash;No; he may frequent the best
companies for years together, and all to no purpose. In short, a
man is neither fit for business nor conversation, unless he can
attend to the object before him, be that object what it will.</p>
<br>
<br>
<a name='Knowledge_of_the_World' id="Knowledge_of_the_World"></a>
<h2><i>Knowledge of the World.</i></h2>
<p><b>1.</b> A knowledge of the world, by our own experience and
observation, is so necessary, that without it we shall act very
absurdly, and frequently give offence when we do not mean it. All
the learning and parts in the world will not secure us from it.
Without an acquaintance with life, a man may say very good things,
but time them so ill, and address them so improperly, that he had
much better be silent. Full of himself and his own business, and
inattentive to the circumstances and situations of those he
converses with, he vents it without the least discretion, says
things that he ought not to say, confutes some, shocks others, and
puts the whole company in pain, lest what he utters next should
prove worse than the last. The best direction I can give you in
this matter, is, rather to fall in with the conversation of others,
than start a subject of your own: rather strive to put them more in
conceit with themselves, than to draw their attention to you.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> A novice in life, he who knows little of mankind, but
what he collects from books, lays it down as a maxim, that most men
love flattery; in order therefore to please, he will flatter: but,
how? Without regard either to circumstances or occasions. Instead
of those delicate touches, those soft tints, that serve to heighten
the piece, he lays on his colours with a heavy hand, and daubs
where he means to adorn: in other words, he will flatter so
unseasonably, and, at the same time, so grossly, that while he
wishes to please he puts out of countenance and is sure to offend.
On the contrary, a man of the world, one who has made life his
study, knows the power of flattery as well as he; but then he knows
how to apply it; he watches the opportunity, and does it
indirectly, by inference, comparison and hint.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> Man is made up of such a variety of matter, that, to
search him thoroughly, requires time and attention; for, though we
are all made of the same materials, and have all the same passions,
yet, from a difference in their proportion and combination, we vary
in our dispositions; what is agreeable to one is disagreeable to
another, and what one shall approve, another shall condemn. Reason
is given us to controul these passions, but seldom does it.
Application therefore to the reason of any man will frequently
prove ineffectual, unless we endeavour at the same time to gain his
heart.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> Wherever then you are, search into the characters of
men; find out, if possible, their foible, their governing; passion,
or their particular merit; take them on their weak side, and you
will generally succeed: their prevailing vanity you may readily
discover, by observing; their favourite topic of conversation, for
every one talks most of what he would be thought most to excel
in.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> The time should also be judiciously made choice of.
Every man has his particular times when he may be applied to with
success, the <i>mollia tempora fandi</i>: but these times are not
all the day long; they must be found out, watched, and taken
advantage of. You could not hope for success in applying to a man
about one business, when he was taken up with another, or when his
mind was affected with excess of grief, anger, or the like.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> You cannot judge of other men's minds better than by
studying your own; for, though some men have one foible, and
another has another, yet men, in general, are very much alike.
Whatever pleases or offends you, will in similar circumstances,
please or offend others; if you find yourself hurt when another,
makes you feel his superiority, you will certainly, upon the common
rule of right, <i>do as you would be done by</i>, take care not to
let another feel your superiority, if you have it, especially if
you wish to gain his interest or esteem.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> If disagreeable insinuations, open contradictions, or
oblique sneers vex and anger you, would you use them where you
wished to please? certainly not. Observe then with care the
operations of your own mind; and you may in a great measure read
all mankind.</p>
<p><i>I</i> will allow that one bred up in a cloister or college,
may reason well on the structure of the human mind; he may
investigate the nature of man, and give a tolerable account of his
head, his heart, his passions; and his sentiments: but at the same
time he may know nothing of him; he has not lived with him, and of
course can know but little how those sentiments or those passions
will work; he must be ignorant of the various prejudices,
propensities and antipathies, that always bias him and frequently
determine him.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> His knowledge is acquired only from theory, which
differs widely from practice; and if, he forms his judgment from
that alone, he must be often deceived; whereas a man of the world,
one who collects his knowledge from his own experience and
observation, is seldom wrong; he is well acquainted with the
operations of the human mind, prys into the heart of man, reads
his-words before they are utttered, sees his actions before they
are performed, knows what will please, and what will displease; and
foresees the event of most things.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> Labour then to require this intuitive knowledge;
attend carefully to the address, the arts and manners of those
acquainted with life, and endeavour to imitate them. Observe the
means they take to gain the favour, and conciliate the affections
of those they associate with; pursue those means, and you will soon
gain the esteem of all that know you.</p>
<p>How often have we seen men governed by persons very much their
inferiors in point of understanding, and even without their knowing
it? A proof that some men have more worldly dexterity than others;
they find out the weak and unguarded part, make their attack there,
and the man surrenders.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> Now from a knowledge of mankind we shall learn the
advantage of two things, the command of our temper and our
countenance: a trifling, disagreeable incident shall perhaps anger
one unacquainted withlife, or confound him with same; shall make
him rave like a madman, or look like a fool: but a man of the world
will never understand what he cannot or ought not to resent. If he
should chance to make a slip himself, he will stifle his confusion,
and turn it off with a jest; recovering it with coolness.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> Many people have sense enough to keep their own
secrets; but from being unused to a variety of company, have
unfortunately such a tell-tale countenance, as involuntarily
declares what they would wish to conceal. This is a great
unhappiness; and should as soon as possible be got the better
of.</p>
<p>That coolness of mind and evenness of countenance, which
prevents a discovery of our sentiments, by our words, our actions,
or our looks, is too necessary to pass unnoticed.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> A man who cannot hear displeasing things, without
visible marks of anger or uneasiness; or pleasing ones, without a
sudden burst of joy, a cheerful eye, or an expanded face, is at the
mercy of every knave: for either they will designedly please or
provoke you themselves, to catch your unguarded looks; or they will
seize the opportunity thus to read your very heart, when any other
shall do it. You may possibly tell me, that this coolness must be
natural, for if not, you can never acquire it.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> I will admit the force of constitution, but people
are very apt to blame that for many things they might readily
avoid. Care, with a little reflection, will soon give you this
mastery of your temper and your countenance. If you find yourself
subject to sudden starts of passion, determine with yourself not to
utter a single word till your reason has recovered itself; and
resolve to keep your countenance as unmoved as possible.</p>
<p><b>14.</b> As a man who at a card-table can preserve a serenity
in his looks, under good or bad luck, has considerably the
advantage of one who appears elated with success, or cast down with
ill fortune, from our being able to read his cards in his face; so
the man of the world, having to deal with one of these babbling
countenances, will take care to profit by the circumstance, let the
consequence, to him with whom he deals, be as injurious as it
may.</p>
<p><b>15.</b> In the course of life, we shall find it necessary
very often to put on a pleasing countenance when, we are
exceedingly displeased; we must frequently seem friendly when we
are quite otherwise. I am sensible it is difficult to accost a man
with smiles whom we know to be our enemy: but what is to be done?
On receiving an affront if you cannot be justified in knocking the
offender down, you must not notice the offence; for in the eye of
the world, taking an affront calmly is considered as cowardice.</p>
<p><b>16.</b> If fools should at any time attempt to be witty upon
you, the best way is not to know their witticisms are levelled at
you, but to conceal any uneasiness it may give you: but, should
they be so plain that you cannot be thought ignorant of their
meaning, I would recommend, rather than quarrel with the company,
joining even in the laugh against yourself: allow the jest to be a
good one, and take it in seeming good humour. Never attempt to
retaliate the same way, as that would imply you were hurt. Should
what is said wound your honour or your moral character, there is
but one proper reply, which I hope you will never be obliged to
have recourse to.</p>
<p><b>17.</b> Remember there are but two alternatives for a
gentleman; extreme politeness, or the sword. If a man openly and
designedly affronts you, call him oat; but if it does not amount to
an open insult, be outwardly civil; if this does not make him
ashamed of his behaviour, it will prejudice every by-stander in
your favour, and instead of being disgraced, you will come off with
honour. Politeness to those we do not respect, is no more a breach
of faith than <i>your humble servant</i> at the bottom of a
challenge; they are universally understood to be things of
course.</p>
<p><b>18.</b> Wrangling and quarreling are characteristics of a
weak mind: leave that to the women, be <i>you</i> always above it.
Enter into no sharp contest, and pride yourself in shewing, if
possible, more civility to your antagonist than to any other in the
company; this will infallibly bring over all the laughter to your
side, and the person you are contending with will be very likely to
confess you have behaved very handsomely throughout the whole
affair.</p>
<p><b>19.</b> Experience will teach us that though all men consist
principally of the same materials, as I before took notice, yet
from a difference in their proportion, no two men are uniformly the
same: we differ from one another, and we often differ from
ourselves, that is, we sometimes do things utterly inconsistent
with the general tenor of our characters. The wisest man will
occasionally do a weak thing: the most honest man, a wrong thing;
the proudest man, a mean thing; and the worst of men will sometimes
do a good thing.</p>
<p><b>20.</b> On this account, our study of mankind should not be
general; we should take a frequent view of individuals, and though
we may upon the whole form a judgment of the man from his
prevailing passion or his general character, yet it will be prudent
not to determine, till we have waited to see the operation of his
subordinate appetites and humours.</p>
<p><b>21.</b> For example; a man's general character maybe that of
strictly honest; I would not dispute it, because I would not be
thought envious or malevolent; but I would not rely upon this
general character, so as to entrust him with my fortune or my life.
Should this honest man, as is not common, be my rival in power,
interest, or love, he may possibly do things that in other
circumstances he would abhor; and power, interest, and love, let me
tell you, will often put honesty to the severest trial, and
frequently overpower it. I would then ransack this honest man to
the bottom, if I wished to trust him, and as I found him, would
place my confidence accordingly.</p>
<p><b>22.</b> One of the great compositions in our nature is
vanity, to which, all men, more or less, give way. Women have an
intolerable share of it. So flattery, no adulation is too gross for
them; those who flatter them most please them best, and they are
most in love with him who pretends to be most in love with them;
and the least slight or contempt of them is never forgotten. It is
in some measure the same with men; they will sooner pardon an
injury than an insult, and are more hurt by contempt than by
ill-usage. Though all men do not boast of superior talents, though
they pretend not to the abilities of a <i>Pope</i>, a
<i>Newton</i>, or a <i>Bollingbroke</i>, every one pretends to have
common sense, and to discharge his office in life with common
decency; to arraign therefore, in any shape, his abilities or
integrity in the department he holds, is an insult he will not
readily forgive.</p>
<p><b>23.</b> As I would not have you trust too implicitly to a
man, because the world gives him a good character; so I must
particularly caution you against those who speak well of
themselves. In general, suspect those who boast of or affect to
have any one virtue above all others, for they are commonly
impostors. There are exceptions, however, to this rule, for we hear
of prudes that have been made chaste, bullies that have been brave,
and saints that have been religious. Confide only where your own
observation shall direct you; observe not only what is said, but
how it is said, and if you have penetration, you may find out the
truth better by your eyes than your ears; in short, never take a
character upon common report, but enquire into it yourself; for
common report, though it is right in general, may be wrong in
particulars.</p>
<p><b>24.</b> Beware of those who, on a slight acquaintance, make a
tender of their friendship, and seem to place a confidence in you;
'tis ten to one but they deceive and betray you: however, do not
rudely reject them upon such a supposition; you may be civil to
them, though you do not entrust them. Silly men are apt to solicit
your friendship, and unbosom themselves upon the first
acquaintance: such friends cannot be worth hearing, their
friendship being as slender as their understanding; and if they
proffer their friendship with a design to make a property of you,
they are dangerous acquaintance indeed.</p>
<p><b>25.</b> Not but the little friendships of the weak may be of
some use to you, if you do not return the compliment; and it may
not be amiss to seem to accept those of designing men, keeping
them, as it were, in play, that they may not be openly your
enemies; for their enmity is the next dangerous thing to their
friendship. We may certainly hold their vices in abhorrence,
without being marked out as their personal enemy. The general rule
is to have a real reserve with almost every one, and a seeming
reserve with almost no one; for it is very disgusting to seem
reserved, and very dangerous not to be so. Few observe the true
medium. Many are ridiculously misterious upon trifles and many
indiscreetly communicative of all they know.</p>
<p><b>26.</b> There is a kind of short-lived friendship that takes
place among young men, from a connection in their pleasures only; a
friendship too often attended with bad consequences. This companion
of your pleasures, young and unexperienced, will probably, in the
heat of convivial mirth, vow a perpetual friendship, and unfold
himself to you without the least reserve; but new associations,
change of fortune, or change of place, may soon break this
ill-timed connection, and an improper use may be made of it.</p>
<p><b>27.</b> Be one, if you will, in young companies, and bear
your part like others in the social festivity of youth; nay, trust
them with your innocent frolics, but keep your serious matters to
yourself; and if you must at any time make <i>them</i> known, let
it be to some tried friend of great experience; and that nothing
may tempt him to become your rival, let that friend be in a
different walk of life from yourself.</p>
<p>Were I to hear a man making strong protestations, and swearing
to the truth of a thing, that is in itself probable, and very
likely to be, I shall doubt his veracity; for when he takes such
pains to make me believe it, it cannot be with a good design.</p>
<p><b>28.</b> There is a certain easiness or false modesty in most
young people, that either makes them unwilling, or ashamed to
refuse any thing that is asked of them. There is also an unguarded
openness about them, that makes them the ready prey of the artful
and designing. They are easily led away by the feigned friendships
of a knave or a fool, and too rashly place a confidence in them,
that terminates in their loss, and frequently in their ruin.
Beware, therefore, as I said before, of these proffered
friendships; repay them with compliments, but not with confidence.
Never let your vanity make you suppose that people become your
friends upon a slight acquaintance: for good offices must be shewn
on both sides to create a friendship; it will not thrive, unless
its love be mutual; and it requires time to ripen it.</p>
<p><b>29.</b> There is still among young people another kind of
friendship merely nominal, warm indeed for the time, but
fortunately of no long continuance. This friendship takes its rise
from their pursuing the same course of riot and debauchery; their
purses are open to each other, they tell one another all they know,
they embark in the same quarrels, and stand by each other on all
occasions. I should rather call this a confederacy against good
morals and good manners, and think it deserves the severest lash of
the law; but they have the impudence to call it friendship.
However, it is often as suddenly dissolved as it is hastily
contracted; some accident disperses them, and they presently forget
each other, except it is to betray and laugh at their own egregious
folly.</p>
<p>In short, the sum of the whole is, to make a wide difference
between companions and friend; for a very agreeable companion has
often proved a very dangerous friend.</p>
<br>
<br>
<a name='Choice_of_Company' id="Choice_of_Company"></a>
<h2><i>Choice of Company.</i></h2>
<p><b>1.</b> The next thing to the choice of friends is the choice
of your company.</p>
<p>Endeavour as much as you can to keep good company, and the
company of your superiors: for you will be held in estimation
according to the company you keep. By superiors I do not mean so
much with regard to birth, as merit and the light in which they are
considered by the world.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> There are two sorts of good company; the one consists
of persons of birth, rank, and fashion; the other of those who are
distinguished by some peculiar merit, in any liberal art or
science; as men of letters, &amp;c. and a mixture of these is what
I would have understood by good company; for it is not what
particular sets of people shall call themselves, but what the
people in general acknowledge to be so, and are the accredited good
company of the place.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> Now and then, persons without either birth, rank, or
character, will creep into good company, under the protection of
some considerable personage; but, in general, none are admitted of
mean degree, or infamous moral character.</p>
<p>In this fashionable good company alone, can you learn the best
manners and the best language, for, as there is no legal standard
to form them by, 'tis here they are established.</p>
<p>It may possibly be questioned whether a man has it always in his
power to get into good company: undoubtedly, by deserving it, he
has; provided he is in circumstances which enable him to live and
appear in the style of a gentleman. Knowledge, modesty, and
good-breeding, will endear him to all that see him; for without
politeness, the scholar is no better than a pedant, the philosopher
than a cynic, the soldier than a brute, nor any man than a
clown.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> Though the company of men of learning and genius is
highly to be valued, and occasionally coveted, I would by no means
have you always found in such company. As they do not live in the
world, they cannot have that easy manner and address which I would
wish you to acquire. If you can bear a part in such company, it is
certainly adviseable to be in it sometimes, and you will be the
more esteemed in other company by being so; but let it not engross
you, lest you be considered as one of the <i>literati</i>, which,
however respectable in name, is not the way to rise or shine in the
fashionable world.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> But the company, which, of all others, you should
carefully avoid, is that, which, in every sense of the word, may be
called <i>low</i>; low in birth, low in rank, low in parts, and low
in manners; that company, who, insignificant and contemptible in
themselves, think it an honour to be seen with <i>you</i>, and who
will flatter your follies, nay, your very vices, to keep you with
them.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> Though <i>you</i> may think such a caution
unnecessary, <i>I</i> do not; for many a young gentleman of sense
and rank has been led by his vanity to keep such company, till he
has been degraded, villified and undone.</p>
<p>The vanity I mean, is that of being the first of the company.
This pride, though too common, is idle to the last degree. Nothing
in the world lets a man down so much. For the sake of dictating,
being applauded and admired by this low company, he is disgraced
and disqualified for better. Depend upon it, in the estimation of
mankind you will sink or rise to the level of the company you
keep.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> Be it then your ambition to get into the best company;
and, when there, imitate their virtues, but not their vices. You
have no doubt, often heard of genteel and fashionable vices. These
are whoring, drinking, and gaming. It has happened that some men
even with these vices, have been admired and esteemed. Understand
this matter rightly; it is not their vices for which they are
admired; but for some accomplishments they at the same time
possess; for their parts, their learning, or their good-breeding.
Be assured, were they free from their vices, they would be much
more esteemed. In these mixed characters, the bad part is
overlooked, for the sake of the good.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> Should you be unfortunate enough to have any vices of
your own, add not to their number by adopting the vices of others.
Vices of adoption are of all others the most unpardonable, for they
have not inadvertency to plead. If people had no vices but their
own, few would have so many as they have.</p>
<p>Imitate, then, only the perfections you meet with; copy the
politeness, the address, the easy manners of well-bred people; and
remember, let them shine ever so bright, if they have any vices,
they are so many blemishes, which it would be as ridiculous to
imitate, as it would to make an artificial wart on one's face,
because some very handsome man had the misfortune to have a natural
one upon his.</p>
<br>
<br>
<a name='Laughter' id="Laughter"></a>
<h2><i>Laughter.</i></h2>
<p><b>1.</b> Let us now descend to minuter matters, which, tho' not
so important as those we have mentioned, are still far from
inconsiderable. Of these laughter is one.</p>
<p>Frequent and loud laughter is a sure sign of a weak mind, and no
less characteristic of a low education. It is the manner in which
low-bred men express their silly joy, at silly things, and they
call it being merry.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> I do not recommend upon all occasions a solemn
countenance. A man may smile; but if he would be thought a
gentleman and a man of sense, he would by no means laugh. True wit
never yet made a man of fashion laugh; he is above it. It may
create a smile; but as loud laughter shews that a man has not the
command of himself, every one who would with to appear sensible,
must abhor it.</p>
<p>A man's going to set down, on a supposition that he has a chair
behind him, and falling for want of one, occasions a general laugh,
when the best piece of wit would not do it: a sufficient proof how
low and unbecoming laughter is.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> Besides, could the immoderate laugher hear his own
noise, or see the face he makes, he would despise himself for his
folly. Laughter being generally supposed to be the effect of gaity,
its absurdity is not properly attended to; but a little reflection
will easily restrain it, and when you are told it is a mark of
low-breeding, I persuade myself you will endeavour to avoid it.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> Some people have a silly trick of laughing whenever
they speak, so that they are always on the grin, and their faces
are ever distorted. This and a thousand other tricks, such as
scratching their heads, twirling their hats, fumbling with their
button, playing with their fingers, &amp;c. are acquired from a
false modesty at their first out-set in life. Being shame-faced in
company, they try a variety of ways to keep themselves in
countenance; thus, they fall into those awkward habits I have
mentioned, which grow upon them, and in time become habitual.</p>
<p>Nothing is more repugnant likewise to good-breeding than
horse-play of any sort, romping, throwing things at one another's
heads, and so on. They may pass well enough with the mob; but they
lessen and degrade the gentleman.</p>
<br>
<br>
<a name='Sundry_little_Accomplishments' id=
"Sundry_little_Accomplishments"></a>
<h2><i>Sundry little Accomplishments.</i></h2>
<p><b>1.</b> I have had reason to observe before, that various
little matters, apparently trifling in themselves, conspire to form
the <i>whole</i> of pleasing, as in a well-finished portrait, a
variety of colours combine to complete the piece. It not being
necessary to dwell much upon them, I shall content myself with just
mentioning them as they occur.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> To do the honours of a table gracefully, is one of the
outlines of a well-bred man; and to carve well, is an article,
little as it may seem, that is useful twice every day, and the
doing of which ill is not only troublesome to one's self, but
renders us disagreeable and ridiculous to others. We are always in
pain for a man who, instead of cutting up a fowl genteelly, is
hacking for half an hour across the bone, greasing himself, and
bespattering the company with the sauce. Use, with a little
attention, is all that is requisite to acquit yourself well in this
particular.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> To be well received, you must also pay some attention
to your behaviour at table, where it is exceedingly rude to scratch
any part of your body; to spit, or blow your nose, if you can
possibly avoid it, to eat greedily, to lean your elbows on the
table, to pick your teeth before the dishes are removed, or to
leave the table before grace is said.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> Drinking of healths is now growing out of fashion, and
is very unpolite in good company. Custom once had made it
universal, but the improved manners of the age now render it
vulgar. What can be more rude or ridiculous, than to interrupt
persons at their meals with an unnecessary compliment? Abstain then
from this silly custom, where you find it out of use; and use it
only at those tables where it continues general.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> A polite manner of refusing to comply with the
solicitations of a company, is also very necessary to be learnt,
for a young man who seems to have no will of his own, but does
every thing that is asked of him, may be a very good-natured
fellow, but he is a very silly one. If you are invited to drink at
any man's house, more than you think is wholesome, you may say,
"you wish you could, but that so little makes you both drunk and
sick, that you shall only be bad company by doing it: of course beg
to be excused."</p>
<p><b>6.</b> If desired to play at cards deeper than you would,
refuse it ludicrously; tell them, "If you were sure to lose, you
might possibly sit down; but that as fortune may be favourable, you
dread the thought of having too much money, ever since you found
what an incumbrance it was to poor Harlequin, and therefore you are
resolved never to put yourself in the way of winning more than such
and such a sum a day." This light way of declining invitations to
vice and folly, is more becoming a young man, than philosophical or
sententious refusals, which would only be laughed at.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> Now I am on the subject of cards, I must not omit
mentioning the necessity of playing them well and genteelly, if you
would be thought to have kept good company. I would by no means
recommend playing at cards as a part of your study, lest you should
grow too fond of it, and the consequences prove bad. It were better
not to know a diamond from a club, than to become a gambler; but,
as custom has introduced innocent card playing at most friendly
meetings, it marks the gentleman to handle them genteelly, and play
them well; and as I hope you will play only for small sums, should
you lose your money pray lose it with temper: or win, receive your
winnings without either elation or greediness.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> To write well and correct, and in a pleasing style, is
another part of polite education. Every man who has the use of his
eyes and his right hand, can write whatever hand he pleases.
Nothing is so illiberal as a school-boy's scrawl. I would not have
you learn a stiff formal hand-writing, like that of a
school-master, but a genteel, legible, and liberal hand, and to be
able to write quick. As to the correctness and elegancy of your
writing, attention to grammar does the one, and to the best
authors, the other. Epistolary correspondence should not be carried
on in a studied or affected style, but the language should flow
from the pen, as naturally and as easily as it would from the
mouth. In short, a letter should be penned in the same style as you
would talk to your friend, if he was present.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> If writing well shews the gentleman, much more so does
spelling well. It is so essentially necessary for a gentleman, or a
man of letters, that one false spelling may fix a ridicule on him
for the remainder of his life. Words in books are generally well
spelled, according to the orthography of the age; reading,
therefore, with attention, will teach every one to spell right. It
sometimes happens, that words shall be spelled differently by
different authors; but, if you spell them upon the authority of one
in estimation of the public, you will escape ridicule. Where there
is but one way of spelling a word, by your spelling it wrong, you
will be sure to be laughed at. For a <i>woman</i> of a tolerable
education would laugh at and despise her lover, if he wrote to her,
and the words were ill-spelled. Be particularly attentive, then, to
your spelling.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> There is nothing that a man at his first appearance
in life ought more to dread than having any ridicule fixed on him.
In the estimation even of the most rational men, it will not only
lessen him, but ruin him with all the rest. Many a man has been
undone by a ridiculous nick-name. The causes of nick-names among
well-bred men, are generally the little defects in manner, air, or
address. To have the appellation of ill-bred, aukward, muttering,
left-legged, or any other tacked always to your name, would injure
you more than you are aware of; avoid then these little defects
(and they are easily avoided) and you need never fear a
nick-name.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> Some young men are apt to think, that they cannot be
complete gentlemen, without becoming men of pleasure. A rake is
made up of the meanest and most disgraceful vices. They all combine
to degrade his character, and ruin his health, and fortune. A man
of pleasure will refine upon the enjoyments of the age, attend them
with decency, and partake of them becomingly.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> Indeed he is too often less scrupulous than he should
be, and frequently has cause to repent it. A man of pleasure, at
best, is but a dissipated being, and what the rational part of
mankind most abhor; I mention it, however, lest, in taking, up the
man of pleasure, you should fall into the rake; for, of two evils,
always chuse the least. A dissolute flagitious footman may make as
good a rake as a man of the first quality. Few man can be men of
pleasure; every man may be a rake.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> There is a certain dignity that should be preserved
in all our pleasures; in love, a man may lose his heart, without
losing his nose; at table a man may have a distinguished palate,
without being a glutton; he may love wine without being a drunkard;
he may game without being a gambler, and so on.</p>
<p><b>14.</b> Every virtue has its kindred vice, and every pleasure
its neighbouring disgrace. Temperance and moderation mark the
gentleman, but excess the blackguard. Attend carefully, then, to
the line that divides them; and remember, stop rather a yard short,
than step an inch beyond it. Weigh the present enjoyment of your
pleasures against the necessary consequences of them, and I will
leave you to your own determination.</p>
<p><b>15.</b> A gentleman has ever some regard also to the
<i>choice</i> of his amusements. If at cards, he will not be seen
at cribbage, all-fours, or putt; or, in sports of exercise, at
skittles, foot-ball, leap-frog, cricket, driving of coaches,
&amp;c. but will preserve a propriety in every part of his conduct;
knowing, that any imitation of the manners of the mob, will
unavoidably stamp him with vulgarity. There is another amusement
too, which I cannot help calling illiberal, that is, playing upon
any musical instrument.</p>
<p><b>16.</b> Music is commonly reckoned one of the liberal arts,
and undoubtedly is so; but to be piping or fiddling at a concert,
is degrading to a man of fashion. If you love music, hear it; pay
fiddlers to play to you, but never fiddle yourself. It makes a
gentleman appear frivolous and contemptible, leads him frequently
into bad company, and wastes that time which might otherwise be
well employed.</p>
<p><b>17.</b> Secrecy is another characteristic of good-breeding.
Be careful not to tell in one company, what you see or hear in
another; much less to divert the present company at the expense of
the last. Things apparently indifferent may, when often repeated
and told abroad, have much more serious consequences than imagined.
In conversation there is generally a tacit reliance, that what is
said will not be repeated; and a man, though not enjoined to
secrecy, will be excluded company, if found to be a tattler;
besides, he will draw himself into a thousand scrapes, and every
one will be afraid to speak before him.</p>
<p><b>18.</b> Pulling out your watch in company unasked, either at
home or abroad, is a mark of ill-breeding; if at home, it appears
as if you were tired of your company, and wished them to be gone;
if abroad, as if the hours drag heavily, and you wished to be gone
yourself. If you want to know the time, withdraw; besides, as the
taking what is called a French leave was introduced, that on one
person's leaving the company the rest might not be disturbed,
looking at your watch does what that piece of politeness was
designed to prevent: it is a kind of dictating to all present, and
telling them it is time, or almost time, to break up.</p>
<p><b>19.</b> Among other things, let me caution you against ever
being in a hurry; a man of sense may be in haste, but he is never
in a hurry; convinced, that hurry is the surest way to make him do
what he undertakes ill. To be in a hurry, is a proof that the
business we embark in is too great for us; of course, it is the
mark of little minds, that are puzzled and perplexed when they
should be cool and deliberate; they wish to do every thing at once,
and are thus able to do nothing. Be steady, then, in all your
engagements; look round you before you begin; and remember, that
you had better do half of them well, and leave the rest undone,
than to do the whole indifferently.</p>
<p><b>20.</b> From a kind of false modesty, most young men are apt
to consider familiarity as unbecoming. Forwardness I allow is so;
but there is a decent familiarity that is necessary in the course
of life. Mere formal visits, upon formal invitations, are not the
thing; they create no connection, nor will they prove of service to
you; it is the careless and easy ingress and egress, at all hours,
that secures an acquaintance to our interest, and this is acquired
by a respectful familiarity entered into, without forfeiting your
consequence.</p>
<p><b>21.</b> In acquiring new acquaintance, be careful not to
neglect your old, for a slight of this kind is seldom forgiven. If
you cannot be with your former acquaintance so often as you used to
be, while you had no others, take care not to give them cause to
think you neglect them; call upon them frequently though you cannot
stay long with them; tell them you are sorry to leave them so soon,
and nothing should take you away but certain engagements which good
manners obliged you to attend to; for it will be your interest to
make all the friends you can, and as few enemies as possible.</p>
<p><b>22.</b> By friends, I would not be understood to mean
confidential ones; but persons who speak of you respectfully, and
who, consistent with their own interest, would wish to be of
service to you, and would rather do you good than harm.</p>
<p>Another thing I must recommend to you, as characteristic of a
polite education, and of having kept good company, is a graceful
manner of conferring favours. The most obliging things may be done
so aukwardly as to offend, while the most disagreeable things may
be done so agreeable as to please.</p>
<p><b>23.</b> A few more articles of general advice, and I have
done; the first is on the subject of vanity. It is the common
failing of youth, and as such ought to be carefully guarded
against. The vanity I mean, is that which, if given way to, stamps
a man a coxcomb, a character he will find a difficulty to get rid
of, perhaps as long as he lives. Now this vanity shews itself in a
variety of shapes; one man shall pride himself in taking the lead
in all conversations, and peremptorily deciding upon every subject;
another, desirous of appearing successful among the women, shall
insinuate the encouragement he has met with, the conquests he
makes, and perhaps boasts of favours he never received; if he
speaks the truth, he is ungenerous; if false, he is a villain; but
whether true or false, he defeats his own purposes, overthrows the
reputation he wishes to erect, and draws upon himself contempt in
the room of respect.</p>
<p><b>24.</b> Some men are vain enough to think they acquire
consequence by alliance, or by an acquaintance with persons of
distinguished character or abilities: hence they are eternally
taking of their grand-father, Lord such-a-one; their kinsman, Sir
William such-a-one; or their intimate friend, Dr. such-a-one, with
whom, perhaps, they are scarce acquainted. If they are ever found
out (and that they are sure to be one time or other) they become
ridiculous and contemptible; but even admitting what they say to be
true, what then? A man's intrinsic merit does not arise from an
ennobled alliance, or a reputable acquaintance.</p>
<p><b>25.</b> A rich man never borrows. When angling for praise,
modesty is the surest bait. If we would wish to shine in any
particular character, we must never affect that character. An
affectation of courage will make a man pass for a bully; an
affectation of wit, for a coxcomb; and an affectation of sense, for
a fool. Not that I would recommend bashfulness or timidity; no: I
would have every one know his own value, yet not discover that he
knows it, but leave his merit to be found out by others.</p>
<p><b>26.</b> Another thing worth your attention is, if in company
with an inferior, not to let him feel his inferiority; if he
discovers it himself without your endeavours, the fault is not
yours, and he will not blame you; but if you take pains to mortify
him, or to make him feel himself inferior to you in abilities,
fortune, or rank, it is an insult that will not readily be
forgiven. In point of abilities, it would be unjust, as they are
out of his power; in point of rank or fortune, it is ill-natured
and ill-bred.</p>
<p><b>27.</b> This rule is never more necessary than at table,
where there cannot be a greater insult than to help an inferior to
a part he dislikes, or a part that may be worse than ordinary, and
to take the best to yourself. If you at any time invite an inferior
to your table, you put him during the time he is there upon an
equality with you, and it is an act of the highest rudeness to
treat him in any respect slightingly. I would rather double my
attention to such a person, and treat him with additional respect,
lest he should even suppose himself neglected.</p>
<p><b>28.</b> There cannot be a greater savageness or cruelty, or
any thing more degrading to a man of fashion, than to put upon, or
take unbecoming liberties with him, whose modesty, humility, or
respect, will not suffer him to retaliate. True politeness consists
in making every body happy about you; and as to mortify is to
render unhappy, it can be nothing but the worst of breeding. Make
it a rule, rather to flatter a person's vanity than otherwise; make
him, if possible, more in love with himself, and you will be
certain to gain his esteem; never tell him any thing he may not
like to hear, nor say things that will put him out of countenance,
but let it be your study on all occasions to please: this will be
making friends instead of enemies; and be a means of serving
yourself in the end.</p>
<p><b>29.</b> Never be witty at the expense of any one present, to
gratify that idle inclination which is too strong in most young
men, I mean, laughing at, or ridiculing the weaknesses or
infirmities of others, by way of diverting the company, or
displaying your own superiority. Most people have their weaknesses,
their peculiar likings and aversions. Some cannot bear the sight of
a cat; others the smell of cheese, and so on; was you to laugh at
those men for their antipathies, or by design or inattention to
bring them in their way, you could not insult them more.</p>
<p><b>30.</b> You may possibly thus gain the laugh on your side for
the present, but it will make the person, perhaps, at whose expense
you are merry, your enemy for ever after; and even those who laugh
with you, will, on a little reflection, fear you, and probably
despise you: whereas to procure what <i>one</i> likes, and to
remove what the <i>other</i> hates, would shew them that they were
objects of your attention, and possibly make them more your friends
than much greater services would have done.</p>
<p><b>31.</b> If you have wit, use it to please, but not to hurt.
You may shine, but take care not to scorch. In short, never seem to
see the faults of others. Though among the mass of men there are,
doubtless, numbers of fools and knaves, yet were we to tell every
one of these we meet with that we knew them to be so, we should be
in perpetual war. I would detest the knave and pity the fool,
wherever I found him, but I would let neither of them know
unnecessarily that I did so; as I would not be industrious to make
myself enemies. As one must please others then, in order to be
pleased one's self, consider what is agreeable to you must be
agreeable to them, and conduct yourself accordingly.</p>
<p><b>32.</b> Whispering in company is another act of ill-breeding;
it seems to insinuate either that the persons whom we would not
wish should hear, are unworthy of our confidence, or it may lead
them to suppose we are speaking improperly of them; on both
accounts, therefore, abstain from it.</p>
<p>So pulling out one letter after another, and reading them in
company, or cutting or pairing one's nails, is unpolite and rude.
It seems to say, we are weary of the conversation, and are in want
of some amusement to pass away the time.</p>
<p><b>33.</b> Humming a tune to ourselves, drumming with our
fingers on the table, making a noise with our feet, and such like,
are all breaches of good manners, and indications of our contempt
for the persons present; therefore they should hot be indulged.</p>
<p>Walking fast in the streets is a mark of vulgarity, implying
hurry of business; it may appear well in a mechanic or tradesman,
but suits ill with the character of a gentleman or a man of
fashion.</p>
<p>Staring any person you meet, full in the face, is an act also of
ill-breeding; it looks as if you saw something wonderful in his
appearance, and is, therefore, a tacit reprehension.</p>
<p><b>34.</b> Eating quick, or very slow, at meals, is
characteristic of the vulgar; the first infers poverty, that you
have not had a good meal for some time; the last, if abroad, that
you dislike your entertainment; if at home, that you are rude
enough to set before your friends, what you cannot eat yourself. So
again, eating your soups with your nose in the plate, is vulgar; it
has the appearance of being used to hard work; and of course an
unsteady hand.</p>
<br>
<br>
<a name='Dignity_of_Manners' id="Dignity_of_Manners"></a>
<h2><i>Dignity of Manners</i>.</h2>
<p><b>1.</b> A certain dignity of manners is absolutely necessary,
to make even the most-valuable character either respected or
respectable in the world.</p>
<p>Horse-play, romping, frequent and loud fits of laughter, jokes,
waggery, and indiscriminate familiarity, will sink both merit and
knowledge into a degree of contempt. They compose at most a merry
fellow, and a merry fellow was never yet a respectable man.
Indiscriminate familiarity either offends your superiors, or else
dubs you their dependent and led captain. It gives your inferiors
just, but troublesome and improper claims to equality. A joker is
near a-kin to a buffoon; and neither of them is the least related
to wit.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> Mimicry, the favorite amusement of little minds, has
been ever the contempt of great ones. Never give way to it
yourself, nor ever encourage it in others; it is the most illiberal
of all buffoonery; it is an insult on the person you mimic; and
insults, I have often told you, are seldom forgiven.</p>
<p>As to a mimic or a wag, he is little else than a buffoon, who
will distort his mouth and his eyes to make people laugh. Be
assured, no one person ever demeaned himself to please the rest,
unless he wished to be thought the Merry-Andrew of the company, and
whether this character is respectable, I will leave you to
judge.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> If a man's company is coveted on any other account
than his knowledge, his good sense, or his manners, he is seldom
respected by those who invite him, but made use of only to
entertain&mdash;"Let's have such a one, for he sings a good song,
for he is always joking or laughing;" or, "let's send for such a
one, for he is a good bottle companion;" these are degrading
distinctions, that preclude all respect and esteem. Whoever is
<i>had</i> (as the phrase is) for the sake of any qualification,
singly, is merely that thing he is <i>had</i> for, is never
considered in any other light, and, of course, never properly
respected, let his intrinsic merits be what they will.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> You may possibly suppose this dignity of manners to
border upon pride; but it differs as much from pride, as true
courage from blustering.</p>
<p>To flatter a person right or wrong, is abject flattery, and to
consent readily to every thing proposed by a company, be it silly
or criminal, is full as degrading, as to dispute warmly upon every
subject, and to contradict, upon all occasions. To preserve
dignity, we should modestly assert our own sentiments, though we
politely acquiesce in those of others.</p>
<p>So again, to support dignity of character, we should neither be
frivolously curious about trifles, nor be laboriously intent on
little objects that deserve not a moment's attention; for this
implies an incapacity in matters of greater importance.</p>
<p>A great deal likewise depends upon our air, address, and
expressions; an aukward address and vulgar expressions, infer
either a low turn of mind, or a low education.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> Insolent contempt, or low envy, is incompatible also
with dignity of manners. Low-bred persons, fortunately lifted in
the world, in fine clothes and fine equipages, will insolently look
down on all those who cannot afford to make as good an appearance;
and they openly envy those who perhaps make a better. They also
dread the being slighted; of course are suspicious and captious;
are uneasy themselves, and make every body else so about them.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> A certain degree of outward seriousness in looks and
actions, gives dignity, while a constant smirk upon the face (with
that insipid silly smile fools have when they would be civil) and
whiffling motions, are strong marks of futility.</p>
<p>But above all, a dignity of character is to be acquired best by
a certain firmness in all our actions. A mean, timid, and passive
complaisance, lets a man down more than he is aware of: but still
his firmness or resolution should not extend to brutality, but be
accompanied with a peculiar and engaging softness, or mildness.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> If you discover any hastiness in your temper, and find
it apt to break out into rough and unguarded expressions, watch it
narrowly, and endeavour to curb it; but let no complaisance, no
weak desire of pleasing, no weedling, urge you to do that which
discretion forbids; but persist and persevere in all that is right.
In your connections and friendships, you will find this rule of use
to you. Invite and preserve attachments by your firmness; but
labour to keep clear of enemies by a mildness of behaviour. Disarm
those enemies you may unfortunately have (and few are without them)
by a gentleness of manner, but make them feel the steadiness of
your just resentment; for there is a wide difference between
bearing malice and a determined self-defence; the one is imperious,
but the other is prudent and justifiable.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> In directing your servants, or any person you have a
right to command, if you deliver your orders mildly and in that
engaging manner which every gentleman should study to do, you will
be cheerfully, and, consequently, well obeyed: but if tyrannically,
you would be very unwillingly served, if served at all. A cool,
steady determination should shew that you <i>will</i> be obeyed,
but a gentleness in the manner of enforcing that obedience should
make service a cheerful one. Thus will you be loved without being
despised, and feared without being hated.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> I hope I need not mention vices. A man who has
patiently been kicked out of company, may have as good a pretence
to courage, as one rendered infamous by his vices, may to dignity
of any kind; however, of such consequence are appearances, that an
outward decency, and an affected dignity of manners, will even keep
such a man the longer from sinking. If, therefore, you should
unfortunately have no intrinsic merit of your own, keep up, if
possible, the appearance of it; and the world will possibly give
you credit for the rest. A versatility of manner is as necessary in
social life, as a versatility of parts in political. This is no way
blameable, if not used with an ill design. We must, like the
cameleon, then, put on the hue of the persons we wish to be well
with; and it surely can never be blameable, to endeavour to gain
the good will or affection of any one, if, when obtained, we do not
mean to abuse it.</p>

<h2><i>Rules for Conversation.</i></h2>
<p><b>1.</b> Jack Lizard was about fifteen when he was first
entered in the university, and being a youth of a great deal of
fire, and a more than ordinary application to his studies; it gave
his conversation a very particular turn. He had too much spirit to
hold his tongue in company; but at the same time so little
acquaintance with the world, that he did not know how to talk like
other people.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> After a year and a half's stay at the university, he
came down among us to pass away a month or two in the country. The
first night after his arrival, as we were at supper, we were all of
us very much improved by <i>Jack's</i> table-talk. He told us, upon
the appearance of a dish of wild-fowl, that according to the
opinion of some natural philosophers, they might be lately come
from the moon.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> Upon which the <i>Sparkler</i> bursting out into a
laugh, he insulted her with several questions, relating to the
bigness and distance of the moon and stars; and after every
interrogatory would be winking upon me, and smiling at his sister's
ignorance. <i>Jack</i> gained his point; for the mother was
pleased, and all the servants stared at the learning of their young
master. <i>Jack</i> was so encouraged at this success, that for the
first week he dealt wholly in paradoxes. It was a common jest with
him to pinch one of his sister's lap-dogs, and afterwards prove he
could not feel it.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> When the girls were sorting a set of knots, he would
demonstrate to them that all the ribbons were of the same colour;
or rather, says <i>Jack</i>, of no colour at all. My Lady
<i>Lizard</i> herself, though she was not a little pleased with her
son's improvements, was one day almost angry with him; for, having
accidentally burnt her fingers as she was lighting her lamp for her
tea-pot, in the midst of her anguish, <i>Jack</i> laid hold of the
opportunity to instruct her that there was no such thing as heat in
fire. In short, no day passed over our heads, in which <i>Jack</i>
did not imagine he made the whole family wiser than they were
before.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> That part of his conversation which gave me the most
pain, was what passed among those country gentlemen that came to
visit us. On such occasions <i>Jack</i> usually took upon him to be
the mouth of the company; and thinking himself obliged to be very
merry, would entertain us with a great many odd sayings and
absurdities of their college cook. I found this fellow had made a
very strong impression upon <i>Jack's</i> imagination, which he
never considered was not the case of the rest of the company, till
after many repeated trials he found that his stories seldom any
body laugh but himself.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> I all this while looked upon <i>Jack</i> as a young
tree shooting out into blossoms before its time; the redundancy of
which, though it was a little unseasonably, seemed to foretell an
uncommon fruitfulness.</p>
<p>In order to wear out the vein of pedantry, which ran through his
conversation, I took him out with me one evening, and first of all
insinuated to him this rule, which I had myself learned from a very
great author, "To think with the wise, but talk with the vulgar,"
<i>Jack's</i>, good sense soon made him reflect that he had exposed
himself to the laughter of the ignorant by a contrary behaviour;
upon which he told me, that he would take care for the future to
keep his notions to himself, and converse in the common received
sentiments of mankind.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> He at the same time desired me to give him any other
rules of conversation, which I thought might he for his
improvement. I told him I would think of it; and accordingly, as I
have a particular affection for the young man, I gave him the next
morning the following rules in writing, which may, perhaps, have
contributed to make him the agreeable man he now is.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> The faculty of interchanging our thoughts with one
another, or what we express by the word conversation, has always
been represented by moral writers, as one of the noblest privileges
of reason, and which more particularly sets mankind above the brute
part of the creation.</p>
<p>Though nothing so much gains upon the affections as this
extempore eloquence, which we have constantly occasion for, and are
obliged to practice every day, we very rarely meet with any who
excel in it.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> The conversation of most men is disagreeable, not so
much for want of wit and learning, as of good-breeding and
discretion.</p>
<p>It is not in every man's power, perhaps, to have fine parts, say
witty things, or tell a story agreeably; but every man may be
polite if he pleases, at least to a certain degree. Politeness has
infinitely more power to make us esteemed, and our company sought
after, than the most extraordinary parts or attainments we can be
master of. These seldom fail to create envy, and envy has always
some ill will in it.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> If you resolve to please never speak to gratify any
particular vanity or passion of your own, but always with a design
either to divert or inform the company. A man who only aims at one
of these, is always easy in his discourse. He is never out of
humour at being interrupted, because he considers that those who
hear him are the best judges whether what he was saying would
either divert or inform him.</p>
<p>A modest person seldom fails to gain the good will of those he
converses with, because nobody envies a man who does not appear to
be pleased with himself.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> We should talk extremely little of ourselves. Indeed
what can we say? It would be as imprudent to discover faults, as
ridiculous to count over our fancied virtues. Our private and
domestic affairs are no less improper to be introduced in
conversation. What does it concern the company how many horses you
keep in your stables? or whether your servant is most knave or
fool?</p>
<p><b>12.</b> A man may equally affront the company he is in, by
engrossing all the talk, or observing a contemptuous silence.</p>
<p>Conform yourself to the taste, character, and present humours of
the persons you converse with; not but a person must follow his
talent in conversation. Do not force nature; no one ever did it
with success.</p>
<p>If you have not a talent for humour, or raillery, or
story-telling, never attempt them.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> Contain yourself also within the bounds of what you
know; and never talk of things you are ignorant of, unless it be
with a view to inform yourself. A person cannot fail in the
observance of this rule, without making himself ridiculous; and yet
how often do we see it transgressed! Some, who on war or politics
could talk very well, will be perpetually haranguing on works of
genius and the belles letters; others who are capable of reasoning,
and would make a figure in grave discourse, will yet constantly aim
at humour and pleasantry, though with the worst grace imaginable.
Hence it is, that we see a man of merit sometimes appear like a
coxcomb, and hear a man of genius talk like a fool.</p>
<p><b>14.</b> Before you tell a story, it may be generally not
amiss to draw a short character, and give the company a true idea
of the principal persons concerned in it; the beauty of most things
consisting not so much in their being said or done, as in their
being said or done by such a particular person; or on such a
particular occasion.</p>
<p><b>15.</b> Notwithstanding all the advantages of youth, few
young people please in conversation: the reason is, that want of
experience makes them positive, and what they say, is rather with a
design to please themselves, than any one else.</p>
<p>It is certain that age itself shall make many things pass well
enough, which would have been laughed at in the mouth of one much
younger.</p>
<p><b>16.</b> Nothing, however, is more insupportable to men of
sense, than an empty formal man who speaks in proverbs, and decides
all controversies with a short sentence. This piece of stupidity is
the more insufferable, as it puts on the air of wisdom.</p>
<p>Great talents for conversation requires to be accompanied with
great politeness. He who eclipses others, owes them great
civilities; and whatever a mistaken vanity may tell us, it is
better to please in conversation, than to shine in it.</p>
<p><b>17.</b> A prudent man will avoid talking much of any
particular science, for which he is remarkably famous. There is
not, methinks, an handsomer thing said of Mr. <i>Cowley</i> in his
whole life, than, that none but his intimate friends ever
discovered he was a great poet by his discourse. Besides the
decency of this rule, it is certainly founded in good policy. A man
who talks of any thing he is already famous for, has little to get,
but a great deal to lose.</p>
<p><b>18.</b> I might add, that he who is sometimes silent on a
subject, where everyone is satisfied he would speak well, will
often be thought no less knowing in any other matters where,
perhaps, he is wholly ignorant.</p>
<p>Women are frightened at the name of argument, and are sooner
convinced by an happy turn, or, witty expression, than by
demonstration.</p>
<p><b>19.</b> Whenever you commend, add your reasons for so doing;
it is this which distinguishes the approbation of a man of sense,
from the flattery of sycophants, and admiration of fools.</p>
<p>Raillery is no longer agreeable, than while the whole company is
pleased with it. I would least of all be understood to except the
person raillied.</p>
<p><b>20.</b> Though good-humour, sense, and discretion, can seldom
fail to make a man agreeable, it may be no ill policy sometimes to
prepare yourself in a particular manner for conversation, by
looking a little farther than your neighbours into whatever is
become a reigning subject. If our armies are besieging a place of
importance abroad, or our House of Commons debating a bill of
consequence at home, you can hardly fail of being heard with
pleasure, if you have nicely informed yourself of the strength,
situation and history of the first, or of the reasons for and
against the latter.</p>
<p><b>21.</b> It will have the same effect if, when any single
person begins to make a noise in the world, you can learn some of
the smallest accidents in his life or conversation, which, though
they are too fine for the observation of the vulgar, give more
satisfaction to men of sense, (as they are the best openings to a
real character) than the recital of his most glaring actions. I
know but one ill consequence to be feared from this method, namely,
that coming full charged into company, you should resolve to
unload, whether an handsome opportunity offers itself or no.</p>
<p><b>22.</b> The liberal arts, though they may possibly have less
effect on our external mein and behaviour, make so deep an
impression on the mind, as is very apt to bend it wholly one
way.</p>
<p>The mathematician will take little less than demonstration in
the most common discourse; and the schoolman is as great a friend
to definitions and syllogisms. The physician and divine are often
heard to dictate in private companies with the same authority which
they exercise over their patients and disciples; while the lawyer
is putting cases, and raising matter for disputation, out of every
thing that occurs.</p>
<p><b>23.</b> Though the asking of questions may plead for itself
the spacious name of modesty, and a desire of information, it
affords little pleasure to the rest of the company, who are not
troubled with the same doubts; besides which, he who asks a
question would do well to consider that he lies wholly at the mercy
of another before he receives an answer.</p>
<p><b>24.</b> Nothing is more silly than the pleasure some people
take in what they call speaking their minds. A man of this make
will say a rude thing for the mere pleasure of saying, it, when an
opposite behaviour, full as, innocent, might have preserved his
friend, or made his fortune.</p>
<p>It is not impossible for a man to form to himself as exquisite a
pleasure in complying with the humour and sentiments of others, as
of bringing others over to his own; since 'tis the certain sign of
a superior genius, that can take and become whatever dress it
pleases.</p>
<p><b>25.</b> Avoid disputes as much as possible, in order to
appear easy and well-bred, in conversation. You may assure
yourself, that it requires more wit, as well as more good-humour,
to improve than to contradict the notions of another; but if you
are at any time obliged to enter on an argument, give your reasons
with the inmost coolness and modesty, two things which scarce ever
fail of making an impression on the hearers. Besides, if you are
neither dogmatical, nor shew either by your actions or words, that
you are full of yourself, all will the more heartily rejoice at
your victory; nay, should, you be pinched in your argument, you may
make your retreat with a very good graces you were never positive,
and are now glad to be better informed.</p>
<p><b>26.</b> This hath made some approve the socratical way of
reasoning, where, while you scarce affirm any thing, you can hardly
be caught in an absurdity; and though possibly you are endeavouring
to bring over another to your opinion, which is firmly fixed, you
seem only to desire information from him.</p>
<p><b>27.</b> In order to keep that temper, which is so difficult
and yet so necessary to preserve, you may please to consider, that
nothing can be more unjust or ridiculous, than to be angry with
another because he is not of your opinion. The interests,
education, and means, by which men attain their knowledge, are so
very different, that it is impossible they should all think alike;
and he has at least us much reason to be angry with you, as you
with him.</p>
<p><b>28.</b> Sometimes to keep yourself cool, it may be of service
to ask yourself fairly, what might have been your opinion, had you
all the biases of education and interest your adversary may
possibly have? But if you contend for the honour of victory alone,
you may lay down this as an infallible maxim, That you cannot make
a more false step, or give your antagonists a greater advantage
over you, than by falling into a passion.</p>
<p><b>29.</b> When an argument is over, how many weighty reasons
does a man recollect, which his heat and violence made him utterly
forget?</p>
<p>It is yet more absurd to be angry with a man, because he does
not apprehend the force of your reasons, or give weak ones of his
own. If you argue for reputation, this makes your victory the
easier; he is certainly in all respects an object of your pity,
rather than anger; and if he cannot comprehend what you do, you
ought to thank nature for her favours, who has given you so much
the clearer understanding.</p>
<p><b>30.</b> You may please to add this consideration, that among
your equals no one values your anger, which only preys upon its
master; and perhaps you may find it not very consistent, either
with prudence or your ease, to punish yourself whenever you meet
with a fool or a knave.</p>
<p><b>31.</b> Lastly, if you propose to yourself the true end of
argument, which is information, it may be a seasonable check to
your passion; for if you search purely after truth, it will be
almost indifferent to you where you find it. I cannot in this place
omit an observation which I have often made, namely, that nothing
procures a man more esteem and less envy from the whole company,
than if he chooses the part of moderator, without engaging directly
on either side in a dispute.</p>
<p><b>32.</b> This gives him the character of impartial, furnishes
him an opportunity of sifting things to the bottom, shewing his
judgment, and of sometimes making handsome compliments to each of
the contending parties.</p>
<p>When you have gained a victory, do not push it too far; it is
sufficient to let the company and your adversary see it is in your
power, but that you are too generous to make use of it.</p>
<p><b>33.</b> I shall only add, that besides what I have here said,
there is something which can never be learnt but in the company of
the polite. The virtues of men are catching as well as their vices,
and your own observations added to these, will soon discover what
it is that commands attention in one man, and makes you tired and
displeased with the discourse of another.</p>

<h2><i>Further Remarks taken from Lord Chesterfield's Letters to
his Son.</i></h2>
<p><b>34.</b> Having now given you full and sufficient instructions
for making you well received in the best of companies; nothing
remains but that I lay before you some few rules for your conduct
in such company. Many things on this subject I have mentioned
before; but some few matters remain to be mentioned now.</p>
<p>Talk, then, frequently, but not long together, lest you tire the
persons you are speaking to; for few persons talk so well upon a
subject, as to keep up the attention of their hearers for any
length of time.</p>
<p><b>35.</b> Avoid telling stories in company, unless they are
very short indeed, and very applicable to the subject you are upon;
in this case relate them in as few words as possible, without the
least digression, and with some apology; as, that you hate the
telling of stories, but the shortness of it induced you. And if
your story has any wit in it, be particularly careful not to laugh
at it yourself. Nothing is more tiresome and disagreeable than a
long tedious narrative; it betrays a gossiping disposition, and
great want of imagination; and nothing is more ridiculous than to
express an approbation of your own story by a laugh.</p>
<p><b>36.</b> In relating any thing, keep clear of repetitions, or
very hackneyed expressions, such as, <i>says he</i>, or <i>says
she</i>. Some people will use these so often, as to take off the
hearers' attention from the story; as in an organ out of tune, one
pipe shall perhaps sound the whole time we are playing, and confuse
the piece so as not to be understood.</p>
<p><b>37.</b> Digressions, likewise, should be guarded against. A
story is always more agreeable without them. Of this kind are,
"<i>the gentleman I am telling you of, is the son of Sir Thomas
&mdash;&mdash;, who lives in Harley-street;&mdash;you must know
him&mdash;his brother had a horse that won the sweepstakes at the
last Newmarket meeting.&mdash;Zounds! if you don't know him you
know nothing</i>." Or, "<i>He was an upright tall old gentleman,
who wore his own long hair; don't you recollect him</i>?"&mdash;All
this is unnecessary, is very tiresome and provoking, and would he
an excuse for a man's behaviour, if he was to leave us in the midst
of our narrative.</p>
<p><b>38.</b> Some people have a trick of holding the persons they
are speaking to by the button, or the hands in order to be heard
out; conscious, I suppose, that their tale is tiresome. Pray, never
do this; if the person you speak to is not as willing to hear your
story as you are to tell it, you had much better break off in the
middle: for if you tire them once, they will be afraid to listen to
you a second time.</p>
<p><b>39.</b> Others have a way of punching the person they are
talking to in the side, and at the end of every sentence, asking
him some questions as the following&mdash;"Wasn't I right in
that?"&mdash;"You know, I told you so."&mdash;"What's your
opinion?" and the like; or, perhaps, they will be thrusting him, or
jogging him with their elbow. For mercy's sake, never give way to
this: it will make your company dreaded.</p>
<p><b>40.</b> Long talkers are frequently apt to single out some
unfortunate man present; generally the most silent one of the
company, or probably him who sits next them. To this man, in a kind
of half whisper, they will run on for half an hour together.
Nothing can be more ill-bred. But, if one of these unmerciful
talkers should attack you, if you wish to oblige him, I would
recommend the hearing with patience: seem to do so at least, for
you could not hurt him more than to leave him in the middle of his
story, or discover any impatience in the course of it.</p>
<p><b>41.</b> Incessant talkers are very disagreeable companions.
Nothing can be more rude than to engross the conversation to
yourself, or to take the words, as it were, out of another man's
mouth. Every man in company has an equal claim to bear his part in
the conversation, and to deprive him of it, is not only unjust, but
a tacit declaration that he cannot speak so well upon the subject
as yourself: you will therefore take it up. And, what can be more
rude? I would as soon forgive a man that should stop my mouth when
I was gaping, as take my words as it were, me while I was speaking
them. Now, if this be unpardonable.</p>
<p><b>42.</b> It cannot be less so to help out or forestall the
slow speaker, as if you alone were rich in expressions, and he were
poor. You may take it for granted, every one is vain enough to
think he can talk well, though he may modestly deny it; helping a
person out, therefore, in his expressions, is a correction that
will stamp the corrector with impudence and ill-manners.</p>
<p><b>43.</b> Those who contradict others upon all occasions, and
make every assertion a matter of dispute, betray by this behaviour
an unacquaintance with good-breeding. He, therefore, who wishes to
appear amiable, with those he converses with, will be cautious of
such expressions as these, "That can't be true, sir." "The affair
is as I say." "That must be false, sir." "If what you say is true,
&amp;c." You may as well tell a man he lies at once, as thus
indirectly impeach his veracity. It is equally as rude to be
proving every trifling assertion with a bet or a wager&mdash;"I'll
bet you fifty of it," and so on. Make it then a constant rule, in
matters of no great importance, complaisantly to submit your
opinion to that of others; for a victory of this kind often costs a
man the loss of a friend.</p>
<p><b>44.</b> Giving advice unasked, is another piece of rudeness:
it is, in effect, declaring ourselves wiser than those to whom we
give it; reproaching them with ignorance and inexperience. It is a
freedom that ought not to be taken with any common acquaintance,
and yet there are these who will be offended, if their advice is
not taken. "Such-a-one," say they, "is above being advised. He
scorns to listen to my advice;" as if it were not a mark of greater
arrogance to expect every one to submit to their opinion, than for
a man sometimes to follow his own.</p>
<p><b>45.</b> There is nothing so unpardonably rude, as a seeming
inattention to the person who is speaking to you; tho' you may meet
with it in others, by all means avoid it yourself. Some ill-bred
people, while others are speaking to them, will, instead of looking
at or attending to them, perhaps fix their eyes on the ceiling, or
some picture in the room, look out of the window, play with a dog,
their watch-chain, or their cane, or probably pick their nails or
their noses. Nothing betrays a more trifling mind than this; nor
can any thing be a greater affront to the person speaking; it being
a tacit declaration, that what he is saying is not worth your
attention. Consider with yourself how you would like such
treatment, and, I am persuaded, you will never shew it to
others.</p>
<p><b>46.</b> Surliness or moroseness is incompatible also with
politeness. Such as, should any one say "he was desired to present
Mr. such-a-one's respects to you," to reply, "What the devil have I
to do with his respects?"&mdash;"My Lord enquired after you lately,
and asked how you did," to answer, "if he wishes to know, let him
come and feel my pulse," and the like. A good deal of this often is
affected; but whether affected or natural, it is always offensive.
A man of this stamp will occasionally be laughed at as an oddity;
but in the end will be despised.</p>
<p><b>47.</b> I should suppose it unnecessary to advise you to
adapt your conversation to the company you are in. You would not
surely start the same subject, and discourse of it in the same
manner, with the old and with the young, with an officer, a
clergyman, a philosopher, and a woman? no; your good sense will
undoubtedly teach you to be serious with the serious, gay with the
gay, and to trifle with the triflers.</p>
<p><b>48.</b> There are certain expressions which are exceedingly
rude, and yet there are people of liberal education that sometimes
use them; as, "You don't understand me, sir." "Is it not so?" "You
mistake." "You know nothing of the matter," &amp;c. Is it not
better to say, "I believe I do not express myself so as to be
understood." "Let us consider it again, whether we take it right or
not." It is much more polite and amiable to make some excuse for
another, even in cases where he might justly be blamed, and to
represent the mistake as common to both, rather than charge him
with insensibility or incomprehension.</p>
<p><b>49.</b> If any one should have promised you any thing, and
not have fulfilled that promise, it would be very impolite to tell
him he has forfeited his word; or if the same person should have
disappointed you, upon any occasion, would it not be better to say,
"You were probably so much engaged, that you forgot my affair;" or,
"perhaps it slipped your memory;" rather than, "you thought no more
about it:" or, "you pay very little regard to your word." For
expressions of this kind leave a sting behind them&mdash;They are a
kind of provocation and affront, and very often bring on lasting
quarrels.</p>
<p><b>50.</b> Be careful not to appear dark and mysterious, lest
you should be thought suspicious; than which, there cannot be a
more unamiable character. If you appear mysterious and reserved,
others will be truly so with you: and in this case, there is an end
to improvement, for you will gather no information. Be reserved,
but never seem so.</p>
<p><b>51.</b> There is a fault extremely common with some people,
which I would have you avoid. When their opinion is asked upon any
subject, they will give it with so apparent a diffidence and
timidity, that one cannot, without the utmost pain, listen to them;
especially if they are known to be men of universal knowledge.
"Your Lordship will pardon me," says one of this stamp, "if I
should not be able to speak to the case in hand, so well as it
might be wished."&mdash;"I'll venture to speak of this matter to
the best of my poor abilities and dullness of
apprehension."&mdash;"I fear I shall expose myself, but in
obedience to your Lordship's commands,"&mdash;and while they are
making these apologies, they interrupt the business and tire the
company.</p>
<p><b>52.</b> Always look people in the face when you speak to
them, otherwise you will be thought conscious of some guilt;
besides, you lose the opportunity of reading their countenances;
from which you will much better learn the impression your discourse
makes upon them, than you can possibly do from their words; for
words are at the will of every one, but the countenance is
frequently involuntary.</p>
<p><b>53.</b> If, in speaking to a person, you are not heard, and
should be desired to repeat what you said, do not raise your voice
in the repetition, lest you should be thought angry, on being
obliged to repeat what you had said before; it was probably owing
to the hearer's inattention.</p>
<p><b>54.</b> One word only, as to swearing. Those who addict
themselves to it, and interlard their discourse with oaths, can
never be considered as gentlemen; they are generally people of low
education, and are unwelcome in what is called good company. It is
a vice that has no temptation to plead, but is, in every respect,
as vulgar as it is wicked.</p>
<p><b>55.</b> Never accustom yourself to scandal, nor listen to it;
for though it may gratify the malevolence of some people, nine
times out of ten it is attended with great disadvantages. The very
person you tell it to, will, on reflection, entertain a mean
opinion of you, and it will often bring you into a very
disagreeable situation. And as there would be no evil-speakers, if
there were no evil-hearers; it is in scandal as in robbery; the
receiver is as bad as the thief. Besides, it will lead people to
shun your company, supposing that you would speak ill of them to
the next acquaintance you meet.</p>
<p><b>56.</b> Carefully avoid talking either of your own or other
people's domestic concerns. By doing the one you will be thought
vain; by entering into the other, you will be considered as
officious. Talking of yourself is an impertinence to the company;
your affairs are nothing to them; besides, they cannot be kept too
secret. And as to the affairs of others, what are they to you? In
talking of matters that no way concern you, you are liable to
commit blunders, and, should you touch any one in a sore part, you
may possibly lose his esteem. Let your conversation, then, in mixed
companies, always be general.</p>
<p><b>57.</b> Jokes, <i>bon-mots</i>, or the little pleasantries of
one company, will not often bear to be told in another; they are
frequently local, and take their rise from certain circumstances; a
second company may not be acquainted with these circumstances, and
of course your story may not be understood, or want explaining; and
if, after you have prefaced it with, "I will tell you a good
thing," the sting should not be immediately perceived, you will
appear exceedingly ridiculous, and wish you had not told it. Never,
then, repeat in one place what you hear in another.</p>
<p><b>58.</b> In most debates, take up the favourable side of the
question; however, let me caution you against being clamorous; that
is, never maintain an argument with heat though you know yourself
right; but offer your sentiments modestly and coolly; and, if this
does not prevail, give it up, and try to change the subject, by
saying something to this effect, "I find we shall hardly convince
one another, neither is there any necessity to attempt it; so let
us talk of something else."</p>
<p><b>59.</b> Not that I would have you give up your opinion
always; no, assert your own sentiments, and oppose those of others
when wrong, but let your manner and voice be gentle and engaging,
and yet no ways affected. If you contradict, do it with, <i>I may
be wrong, but&mdash;I won't be positive, but I really think&mdash;I
should rather suppose&mdash;If I may be permitted to
say</i>&mdash;and close your dispute with good humour, to shew you
are neither displeased yourself, nor meant to displease the person
you dispute with.</p>
<p><b>60.</b> Acquaint yourself with the character and situation of
the company you go into, before you give a loose to your tongue;
for should you enlarge on some virtue, which anyone present may
notoriously want: or should you condemn some vices which any of the
company may be particularly addicted to, they will he apt to think
your reflections pointed and personal, and you will be sure to give
offence. This consideration will naturally lead you, not to suppose
things said in general to be levelled at you.</p>
<p><b>61.</b> Low-bred people, when they happen occasionally to be
in good company, imagine themselves to be the subject of every
separate conversation. If any part of the company whispers, it is
about them; if they laugh, it is at them; and if any thing is said,
which they do not comprehend, they immediately suppose it is meant
of them.&mdash;This mistake is admirably ridiculed in one of our
celebrated comedies, "<i>I am sure</i>, says Scrub, <i>they were
talking of me, for they laughed consumedly</i>."</p>
<p><b>62.</b> Now, a well-bred person never thinks himself
disesteemed by the company, or laughed at, unless their reflections
are so gross, that he cannot be supposed to mistake them, and his
honour obliges him to resent it in a proper manner; however, be
assured, gentlemen never laugh at or ridicule one another, unless
they are in joke, or on a footing of the greatest intimacy. If such
a thing should happen once in an age, from some pert coxcomb, or
some flippant woman, it is better not to seem to know it, than to
make the least reply.</p>
<p><b>63.</b> It is a piece of politeness not to interrupt a person
in a story, whether you have heard it before or not. Nay, if a
well-bred man is asked whether he has heard it, he will answer no,
and let the person go on, though he knows it already. Some are fond
of telling a story, because they think they tell it well; others
pride themselves in being the first teller of it, and others are
pleased at being thought entrusted with it. Now, all these persons
you would disappoint by answering yes; and, as I have told you
before, as the greatest proof of politeness is to make every body
happy about you, I would never deprive a person of any secret
satisfaction of this sort, when I could gratify by a minute's
attention.</p>
<p><b>64.</b> Be not ashamed of asking questions, if such questions
lead to information: always accompany them with some excuse, and
you will never be reckoned impertinent. But, abrupt questions,
without some apology, by all means avoid, as they imply design.
There is a way of fishing for facts, which, if done judiciously,
will answer every purpose, such as taking things you wish to know
for granted: this will, perhaps, lead some officious person to set
you right. So again, by saying, you have heard so and so, and
sometimes seeming to know more than you do, you will often get an
information, which you would lose by direct questions, as these
would put people upon their guard, and frequently defeat the very
end you aim at.</p>
<p><b>65.</b> Make it a rule never to reflect on any body of
people, for by this means you will create a number of enemies.
There are good and bad of all professions, lawyers, soldiers,
parsons or citizens. They are all men, subject to the same
passions, differing only in their manner according to the way they
have been bred up in. For this reason, it is unjust, as well as
indiscreet, to attack them as a <i>corps</i> collectively. Many a
young man has thought himself extremely clever in abusing the
clergy. What are the clergy more than other men? Can you suppose a
black gown can make any alteration in his nature? Fie, fie, think
seriously, and I am convinced you will never do it.</p>
<p><b>66.</b> But above all, let no example, no fashion, no
witticism, no foolish desire of rising above what knaves call
prejudices, tempt you to excuse, extenuate or ridicule the least
breach of morality, but upon every occasion shew the greatest
abhorrence of such proceedings, and hold virtue and religion in the
highest veneration.</p>
<p>It is a great piece of ill-manners to interrupt any one while
speaking, by speaking yourself, or calling off the attention of the
company to any foreign matter. But this every child knows.</p>
<p><b>67.</b> The last thing I shall mention, is that of concealing
your learning, except on particular occasions. Reserve this for
learned men, and let them rather extort it from you, than you be
too willing to display it. Hence you will be thought modest, and to
have more knowledge than you really have. Never seem more wise or
learned than the company you are in. He who affects to shew his
learning, will be frequently questioned; and if found superficial,
will be sneered at; if otherwise, he will be deemed a pedant. Real
merit will always shew itself, and nothing can lessen it in the
opinion of the world, but a man's exhibiting it himself.</p>
<p>For God's sake, revolve all these things seriously in your mind,
before you go abroad into life. Recollect the observations you have
yourself occasionally made upon men and things; compare them with
my instructions, and act wisely and consequentially, as they shall
teach you.</p>

<h2><i>Entrance upon the World</i>.</h2>
<p><b>1.</b> Curino was a young man brought up to a reputable
trade; the term of his apprenticeship was almost expired, and he
was contriving how he might venture into the world with safety, and
pursue business with innocence and success.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> Among his near kindred, Serenus was one, a gentleman
of considerable character in the sacred profession; and after he
had consulted with his father, who was a merchant of great esteem
and experience, he also thought fit to seek a word of advice from
the divine.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> Serenus had such a respect for his young kinsman, that
he set his thought at work on this subject, and with some tender
expressions, which melted the youth into tears, he put into his
hand a paper of his best counsels. Curino entered upon business,
pursued his employment with uncommon advantage, and, under the
blessing of Heaven, advanced himself to a considerable estate.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> He lived with honour in the world, and gave a lustre
to the religion which he professed; and after a long life of piety
and usefulness, he died with a sacred composure of soul, under the
influences of the Christian hope.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> Some of his neighbours wondered at his felicity in
this world, joined with so much innocence, and such severe virtue;
but after his death this paper was found in his closet, which was
drawn up by his kinsman in holy orders, and was supposed to have a
large share in procuring his happiness.</p>
<br>
<br>
<a name='Advice_to_a_young_Man' id="Advice_to_a_young_Man"></a>
<h2><i>Advice to a young Man.</i></h2>
<p><b>1.</b> I presume you desire to be happy here and hereafter;
you know there are a thousand difficulties which attend this
pursuit; some of them perhaps you foresee, but there are multitudes
which you could never think of. Never trust therefore to your own
understanding in the things of this world, where you can have the
advice of a wise and faithful friend; nor dare venture the more
important concerns of your soul, and your eternal interests in the
world to come, upon the mere light of nature, and the dictates of
your own reason; since the word of God, and the advice of Heaven,
lies in your hands. Vain and thoughtless indeed are those children
of pride, who chuse to turn heathens in America; who live upon the
mere religion of nature and their own stock, when they have been
trained up among all these superior advantages of Christianity, and
the blessings of divine revelation and grace!</p>
<p><b>2.</b> Whatsoever your circumstances may be in this world,
still value your bible as your best treasure; and whatsoever be
your employment here, still look upon religion as your best
business. Your bible contains eternal life in it, and all the
riches of the upper world; and religion is the only way to become
the possessor of them.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> To direct your carriage towards God, converse
particularly with the book of Psalms; David was a man of sincere
and eminent devotion. To behave aright among men, acquaint yourself
with the whole book of Proverbs: Solomon was a man of large
experience and wisdom. And to perfect your directions in both
these, read the Gospels and Epistles; you will find the best of
rules and the best of examples there, and those more immediately
suited to the Christian life.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> As a man, maintain strict temperance and sobriety, by
a wise government of your appetites and passions; as a neighbour,
influence and engage all around you to be your friends, by a temper
and carriage made up of prudence and goodness; and let the poor
have a certain share in all your yearly profits; as a trader, keep
that golden sentence of our Saviour's ever before you. Whatsoever
you "would that men should do unto you, do you also unto them."</p>
<p><b>5.</b> While you make the precepts of scripture the constant
rule of your duty, you may with courage rest upon the promises of
scripture as the springs of your encouragement; all divine
assistances and divine recompenses are contained in them. The
spirit of light and grace is promised to assist them that ask it.
Heaven and glory are promised to reward the faithful and the
obedient.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> In every affair of life, begin with God; consult him
in every thing that concerns you; view him as the author of all
your blessings, and all your hopes, as your best friend, and your
eternal portion. Meditate on him in this view, with a continual
renewal of your trust in him, and a daily surrender of yourself to
him, till you feel that you love him most entirely, that you serve
him with sincere delight, and that you cannot live a day without
God in the world.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> You know yourself to be a man, an indigent creature
and a sinner, and you profess to be a Christian, a disciple of the
blessed Jesus, but never think you know Christ or yourself as you
ought till you find a daily need of him for righteousness and
strength, for pardon and sanctification; and let him be your
constant introducer to the great God, though he sits upon a throne
of grace. Remember his own words, <i>John</i> xiv 6. "No man cometh
to the father but by me."</p>
<p><b>8.</b> Make prayer a pleasure, and not a task, and then you
will not forget nor omit it. If ever you have lived in a praying
family, never let it be your fault if you do not live in one
always. Believe that day, that hour, or those minutes to be wasted
and lost, which any worldly pretences would tempt you to save out
of the public worship of the church, the certain and constant
duties of the closet, or any necessary services for God and
godliness; beware lest a blast attend it, and not a blessing. If
God had not reserved one day in seven to himself, I fear religion
would have been lost out of the world; and every day of the week is
exposed to a curse which has no morning religion.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> See that you watch and labour, as well as pray;
diligence and dependence must he united in the practice of every
Christian. It is the same wise man acquaints us, that the hand of
the diligent, and the blessing of the Lord, join together to make
us rich, <i>Prov</i>. x. 4. 22. Rich in the treasures of body or
mind, of time or eternity.</p>
<p>It is your duty indeed, under a sense of your own weakness, to
pray daily against sin; but if you would effectually avoid it, you
must also avoid temptation, and every dangerous opportunity. Set a
double guard wheresoever you feel or suspect an enemy at hand. The
world without, and the heart within, have so much flattery and
deceit in them, that we must keep a sharp eye upon both, lest we
are trapt into mischief between them.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> Honour, profit, and pleasure, have been sometimes
called the world's Trinity; they are its three chief idols; each of
them is sufficient to draw a soul off from God, and ruin it for
ever. Beware of them, therefore, and of all their subtle
insinuations, if you would be innocent or happy.</p>
<p>Remember that the honour which comes from God, the approbation
of Heaven, and your own conscience, are infinitely more valuable
than all the esteem or applause of men. Dare not venture one step
out of the road of Heaven, for fear of being laughed at for walking
strictly in it, it is a poor religion that cannot stand against a
jest.</p>
<p>Sell not your hopes of heavenly treasures, nor any thing that
belongs to your eternal interest, for any of the advantages of the
present life; "What shall it profit a man to gain the world and
lose his own soul."</p>
<p>Remember also the words of the wise man, "He that loveth
pleasure shall be a poor man;" he that indulges himself in "wine
and oil," that is, in drinking, in feasting, and in sensual
gratifications, "shall not be rich." It is one of St. Paul's
characters of a most degenerate age, when "men become lovers of
pleasure more than lovers of God." And that "fleshly lusts war
against the soul," is St. Peter's caveat to the Christians of his
time.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> Preserve your conscience always soft and sensible; if
but one sin force its way into that tender part of the soul, and
dwell easy there, the road is paved for a thousand; iniquities.</p>
<p>And take heed that under any scruple, doubt, or temptation
whatsoever, you never let any reasonings satisfy your conscience,
which will not be a sufficient answer of apology to the great Judge
at the last day.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> Keep this thought ever in your mind. It is a world of
vanity and vexation in which you live; the flatteries and promises
of it are vain and deceitful; prepare, therefore, to meet
disappointments. Many of its occurrences are teazing and vexatious.
In every ruffling storm without, possess your spirit in patience,
and let all be calm and serene within. Clouds and tempests are only
found in the lower skies; the heavens above are ever bright and
clear. Let your heart and hope dwell much in these serene regions;
live as a stranger here on earth, but as a citizen of heaven, if
you will maintain a soul at ease.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> Since in many things we offend all, and there is not
a day passes which is perfectly free from sin, let "repentance
towards God, and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ," be your daily
work. A frequent renewal of these exercises which make a Christian
at first, will be a constant evidence of your sincere Christianity,
and give you peace in life, and hope in death.</p>
<p><b>14.</b> Ever carry about with you such a sense of the
uncertainty of every thing in this life, and of life itself, as to
put nothing off till to-morrow, which you can conveniently do
to-day. Dilatory persons are frequently exposed to surprise and
hurry in every thing that belongs to them; the time is come, and
they are unprepared. Let the concerns of your soul and your shop,
your trade and your religion, lie always in such order, as far as
possible, that death, at a short warning, may be no occasion of a
disquieting tumult in your spirit, and that you may escape the
anguish of a bitter repentance in a dying hour. Farewel.</p>
<p>Phronimus, a considerable East-land merchant, happened upon a

commence a partnership with him in his trade; he transcribed them
with his own hand, and made a present of them to the youth,
together with the articles of partnership. Here, young man, said
he, is a paper of more worth than these articles. Read it over once
a month, till it is wrought in your very soul and temper. Walk by
these rules, and I can trust my estate in your hands. Copy out
these counsels in your life, and you will make me and yourself easy
and happy.</p>

<h2><i>The Vision of Mirza, exhibiting a Picture of Human
Life.</i></h2>
<p><b>1.</b> On the fifth day of the moon, which, according to the
custom of my forefathers, I always keep holy, after having washed
myself, and offered up my morning devotions, I ascended the high
hills of Bagdat, in order to pass the rest of the day in meditation
and prayer. As I was here airing myself on the tops of the
mountains, I fell into a profound contemplation on the vanity of
human life; and passing from one thought to another, surely, said
I, man is but a shadow, and life a dream.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> Whilst I was thus musing, I cast my eyes towards the
summit of a rock that was not far from me, where I discovered one
in the habit of a shepherd, with a little musical instrument in his
hand. As I looked upon him, he applied it to his lips, and began to
play upon it. The sound of it was exceeding sweet, and wrought into
a variety of tunes that were inexpressibly melodious, and
altogether different from any thing I had ever heard: they put me
in mind of those heavenly airs that are played to the departed
souls of good men upon their first arrival in Paradise, to wear out
the impressions of the last agonies, and qualify them for the
pleasures of that happy place. My heart melted away in secret
raptures.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> I had often been told that the rock before me was the
haunt of a genius; and that several had been entertained with that
music, who had passed by it, but never heard that the musician had
before made himself visible. When he had raised my thoughts by
those transporting airs which he played, to taste the pleasures of
his conversation, as I looked upon him like one astonished, he
beckoned to me, and, by the waving of his hand, directed me to
approach the place where he sat.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> I drew near with that reverence which is due to a
superior nature; and as my heart was entirely subdued by the
captivating strains I had heard, I fell down at his feet and wept.
The genius smiled on me with a look of compassion and affability,
that familiarized him to my imagination, and at once dispelled all
the fears and apprehensions with which I approached him. He lifted
me from the ground, and taking me by the hand, Mirza, said he, I
have heard thee in thy soliloquies: follow me.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> He then led me to the highest pinnacle of the rock,
and placing me on the top of it, cast thy eyes eastward, said he,
and tell me what thou seest. I see, said I, a huge valley, and a
prodigious tide of water rolling through it.</p>
<p>The valley that then seest, said, he, is the vale of misery and
the tide of water that thou seest, is part of the great tide of
eternity.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> What is the reason, said I, that the tide I see rises
out of a thick mist at one end, and again loses itself in a thick
mist at the other? What thou seest, said he, is that portion of
eternity which is called time, measured out by the sun, and
reaching from the beginning of the world to its consummation.
Examine now, said he, this sea that is bounded with darkness at
both ends, and tell me what thou discoverest in it. I see a bridge,
said I; standing in the midst of the tide. The bridge thou seest
said he, is human life; consider it attentively.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> Upon a more leisurely survey of it, I found that it
consisted of threescore and ten entire arches, with several broken
arches, which, added to those that were entire, made up the number
of about an hundred. As I was counting the arches, the genius told
me that this bridge consisted at the first of a thousand arches;
but that a great flood swept away the rest, and left the bridge in
the ruinous condition I now beheld it; but tell me further, said
he, what thou discoverest on it. I see multitudes of people passing
over it, said I, and a black cloud hanging on each end of it.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> As I looked more attentively, I saw several of the
passengers dropping through the bridge, into the great, tide that
flowed underneath it; and upon further examination, perceived there
were innumerable trap-doors that lay concealed in the bridge, which
the passengers no sooner trod upon, but they fell through them into
the tide, and immediately disappeared. These hidden pitfalls were
set very thick at the entrance of the bridge, so that throngs of
people no sooner broke through the cloud, but many of them fell
into them. They grew thinner, towards the middle, but multiplied
and lay closer together towards the end of the arches that were
entire.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> There were indeed some persons, but their number was
very small, that continued a kind of hobbling march on the broken
arches, but fell through one after another, being quite tired and
spent with so long a walk.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> I passed some time in the contemplation of this
wonderful structure; and the great variety of objects which it
presented. My heart was filled with a deep melancholy, to see
several dropping unexpectedly in the midst of mirth and jollity,
and catching at every thing that stood by them to save themselves.
Some were looking up towards the heavens in a thoughtful posture,
and in the midst of a speculation, stumbled and fell out of sight.
Multitudes were very busy in the pursuit of bubbles, that glittered
in their eyes and danced before them; but often, when they thought
themselves within the reach of them, their footing failed, and down
they sunk.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> In this confusion of objects, I observed some with
scymitars in their hands, and others with urinals, who ran to and
fro upon the bridge, thrusting several persons on trap-doors, which
did not seem to lie in their way, and which they might have
escaped, had they not been thus forced upon them.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> The genius, seeing me indulge myself in this
melancholy prospect, told me I had dwelt long enough upon it: take
thine eyes off the bridge, says he, and tell me if thou seest any
thing thou dost not comprehend. Upon looking up, what mean, said I,
those great flights of birds that are perpetually hovering about
the bridge, and settling upon it from time to time? I see vultures,
harpies, ravens, cormorants, and, among many other feathered
creatures, several little winged boys, that perch in great numbers
upon the middle arches. These, said the genius, are envy, avarice,
superstition, despair, love, with the like cares and passions that
infest human life.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> I here fetched a deep sigh: Alas, said I, man was
made in vain! how is he given away to misery and mortality!
tortured in life, and swallowed up in death! The genius, being
moved with compassion towards me, bid me quit so uncomfortable a
prospect. Look no more, said he, on man in the first stage of his
existence, in his setting out for eternity; but cast thine eye on
that thick mist into which the tide bears the several generations
of mortals that fall into it.</p>
<p><b>14.</b> I directed my sight as I was ordered, and (whether or
no the good genius strengthened it with any supernatural force, or
dissipated part of the mist that was before too thick for the eye
to penetrate) I saw the valley opening; at the farther end, and
spreading forth into an immense ocean, that had a huge rock of
adamant running through the midst of it, and dividing it into two
equal parts. The clouds still rested on one half of it, insomuch
that I could discover nothing in it; but the other appeared to me a
vast ocean, planted with innumerable islands, that were covered
with fruits and flowers; and interwoven with a thousand little
shining seas that ran among them.</p>
<p><b>15.</b> I could see persons dressed in glorious habits, with
garlands upon their heads, passing among the trees, lying down by
the sides of fountains, or resting on beds of flowers; and could
hear a confused harmony of singing birds, falling waters, human
voices, and musical instruments. Gladness grew in me at the
discovery of so delightful a scene. I wished for the wings of an
eagle, that I might fly away to those happy seats; but the genius
told me there was no passage to them, except through the gates of
death that I saw opening every moment upon the bridge.</p>
<p><b>16.</b> The islands, said he, that are so fresh and green
before thee, and with which the whole face of the ocean appears
spotted as far as thou canst see, are more in number than the sand
on the sea-shore; there are myriads of islands behind those which
thou here discoverest, reaching further than thine eye, or even
thine imagination can extend itself. These are the mansions of good
men after death, who, according to the degree and kinds of virtue
in which they excelled, are distributed among these several
islands, which abound with pleasures of different kinds and
degrees, suitable to the relishes and perfections of those who are
settled in them; every island is a paradise, accommodated to its
respective inhabitants.</p>
<p><b>17.</b> Are not these, O Mirza, habitations worth contending
for? Does life appear miserable, that gives thee opportunities of
earning such a reward? Is death to be feared, that will convey thee
to so happy an existence? Think not man was made in vain, who has
such an eternity reserved for him. I gazed, with inexpressible
pleasure, on these happy islands. At length, said I, shew me now, I
beseech thee, the secrets that lie hid under those dark clouds,
which cover the ocean on the other side of the rock of adamant.</p>
<p><b>18.</b> The genius making me no answer, I turned about to
address myself to him a second time, but I found that he had left
me; I then turned again to the vision which I had been so long
contemplating: but instead of the rolling tide, the arched bridge,
and the happy islands, I saw nothing but the long, hollow valley of
Bagdat, with oxen, sheep, and camels grazing upon the sides of
it.</p>

<h2><i>Riches not productive of Happiness: The Story of Ortogrul of
Basra.</i></h2>
<div style='text-align: right; margin-right: 10%;'>IDLER, No.
99.</div>
<p><b>1.</b> As Ortogrul of Basra was one day wandering along the
streets of Bagdat, musing on the varieties of merchandize which the
shops altered to his view, and observing the different occupations
which busied the multitude on every side, he was awakened from the
tranquillity of meditation by a crowd that obstructed his passage.
He raised his eyes, and saw the Chief Vizier, who, having returned
from the Divan, was entering his palace.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> Ortogrul mingled with the attendants, and being
supposed to have some petiton for the Vizier, was permitted to
enter. He surveyed the spaciousness of the apartments, admired the
walls hung with golden tapestry, and the floors covered with silken
carpets, and despised the simple neatness of his own little
habitation.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> Surely, said he to himself, this palace is the seat of
happiness, where pleasure succeeds to pleasure, and discontent and
sorrow can have no admission. Whatever nature has provided for the
delight of sense, is here spread forth to be enjoyed. What can
mortals hope or imagine, which the master of this palace has not
obtained? The dishes of luxury cover his table, the voice of
harmony lulls him in his bowers; he breathes the fragrance of the
groves of Java, and sleeps upon the down of the cygnets of Ganges.
He speaks, and his mandate is obeyed; he wishes, and his wish is
gratified! all whom he sees obey him, and all whom he hears flatter
him.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> How different, Ortogrul, is thy condition, who art
doomed to the perpetual torments of unsatisfied desire, and who
hast no amusement in thy power that can withhold thee from thy own
reflections! They tell thee that thou art wise, but what does
wisdom avail with poverty? None will flatter the poor, and the wise
have very little power of flattering themselves. That man is surely
the most wretched of the sons of wretchedness, who lives with his
own faults and follies always before him, and who has none to
reconcile him to himself by praise and veneration. I have long
sought content, and have not found it; I will from this moment
endeavour to be rich.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> Full of his new resolution, he shut himself in his
chamber for six months, to deliberate how he should grow rich; he
sometimes proposed to offer himself as a counsellor to one of the
kings of India, and sometimes resolved to dig for diamonds in the
mines of Golconda. One day, after some hours passed in violent
fluctuation of opinion, sleep insensibly seized him in his chair;
he dreamed that he was ranging a desert country in search of some
one that might teach him to grow rich; and as he stood on the top
of a hill shaded with cypress, in doubt whither to direct his
steps, his father appeared on a sudden, standing before him.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> Ortogrul, said the old man, I know thy perplexity;
listen to thy father; turn thine eye on the opposite mountain.
Ortogrul looked, and saw a torrent tumbling down the rocks, roaring
with the noise of thunder, and scattering, its foam on the
impending woods. Now, said his father, behold the valley that lies
between the hills.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> Ortogrul looked, and espied a little well, out of
which issued a small rivulet. Tell me now, said his father, dost
thou wish for sudden affluence, that may pour upon thee like the
mountain torrent, or for a slow and gradual increase, resembling
the rill gliding from the well? Let me be quickly rich, said
Ortogrul; let the golden stream be quick and violent.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> Look round thee, said his father, once again. Ortogrul
looked, and perceived the channel of the torrent dry and dusty; but
following the rivulet from the well, he traced it to a wide lake,
which the supply, slow and constant, kept always full. He waked,
and determined to grow rich by silent profit, and persevering
industry.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> Having sold his patrimony, he engaged in merchandise,
and in twenty years purchased lands, on which he raised a house
equal in sumptuousness to that of the Vizier, to which he invited
all the ministers of pleasure, expecting to enjoy all the felicity
which he had imagined riches able to afford. Leisure soon made him
weary of himself, and he longed to be persuaded that he was great
and happy. He was courteous and liberal; he gave all that
approached him hopes of pleasing him, and all who should please
him, hopes of being rewarded. Every art of praise was tried, and
every source of adulatory fiction was exhausted.</p>
<p>10, Ortogrul heard his flatterers without delight, because he
found himself unable to believe them. His own heart told him its
frailties. His own understanding reproached him with his faults.
How long, said he, with a deep sigh, have I been labouring in vain
to amass wealth, which at last is useless? Let no man hereafter
wish to be rich, who is already too wise to be flattered.</p>

<h2><i>Of the Scriptures, as the Rule of Life.</i></h2>
<p><b>1.</b> As you advance in years and under standing, I hope
you, will be able to examine for yourself the evidence of the
Christian religion, and that you will be convinced, on rational
grounds, of its divine authority. At present, such enquiries would
demand more study, and greater powers of reasoning, than your age
admits of. It is your part, therefore, till you are capable of
understanding the proofs, to believe your parents and teachers,
that the holy scriptures are writings inspired by God, containing a
true history of facts, in which we are deeply concerned&mdash;a
true recital of the laws given by God to Moses, and of the precepts
of our blessed Lord and Saviour, delivered from his own mouth to
his disciples, and repeated and enlarged upon in the edifying
epistles of his Apostles; who were men chosen from amongst those
who had the advantage of conversing with our Lord, to bear witness
of his miracles and resurrection&mdash;and who, after his
ascension, were assisted and inspired by the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> This sacred volume must be the rule of your life. In
it you will find all truths necessary to be believed; and plain and
easy directions for the practice of every duty. Your bible, then,
must be your chief study and delight; but, as it contains many
various kinds of writing&mdash;some parts obscure and difficult of
interpretation, others plain and intelligible to the meanest
capacity&mdash;I would chiefly recommend to your frequent perusal,
such parts of the sacred writings as are most adapted to your
understanding, and most necessary for your instruction.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> Our Saviour's precepts were spoken to the common
people amongst the Jews; and were therefore given in a manner easy
to be understood, and equally striking and instructive to the
learned and unlearned; for the most ignorant may comprehend them,
whilst the wisest must be charmed and awed by the beautiful and
majestic simplicity with, which they are expressed. Of the same
kind are the Ten Commandments, delivered by God to Moses; which, as
they were designed for universal laws, are worded in the most
concise and simple manner, yet with a majesty which commands our
utmost reverence.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> I think you will receive great pleasure, as well as
improvement, from the historical books of the Old Testament;
provided you read them as an history in a regular course, and keep
the thread of it in your mind as you go on. I know of none, true or
fictitious, that is equally wonderful, interesting, or affecting;
or that is told in so short and simple a manner as this, which is
of all histories the most, authentic.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> I shall give you some brief directions, concerning the
method and course I wish you to pursue, in reading the Holy
Scriptures. May you be enabled to make the best use of this most
precious gift of God&mdash;this sacred treasure of
knowledge!&mdash;May you read the bible, not as a task, nor as the
dull employment of that day only in which you are forbidden more
lively entertainments&mdash;but, with a sincere and ardent desire
of instruction; with that love and delight in God's word, which the
holy Psalmist so pathetically felt and described, and which is the
natural consequence of loving God and virtue.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> Though I speak this of the bible in general, I would
not be understood to mean, that every part of the volume is equally
interesting. I have already said, that it consists of various
matter, and various kinds of books, which must be read with
different views and sentiments.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> The having some general notion of what you are to
expect from each book, may possibly help you to understand them. I
shall treat you as if you were perfectly new to the whole; for so I
wish you to consider yourself; because the time and manner in which
children usually read the bible, are very ill-calculated to make
them really acquainted with it; and too many people who have read
it thus, without understanding it in their youth, satisfy
themselves that they know enough of it, and never afterwards study
it with attention when they come to a mature age.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> If the feelings of your heart, whilst you read,
correspond with those of mine whilst I write, I shall not be
without the advantage of your partial affection, to give weight to
my advice; for, believe me, my heart and eyes overflow with
tenderness, when I tell you how warm and earnest my prayers are for
your happiness here and hereafter.</p>
<br>
<a name='Of_Genesis' id="Of_Genesis"></a>
<h2><i>Of Genesis.</i></h2>
<p><b>9.</b> I now proceed to give you some short sketches of the
matter contained in the different books of the Bible, and of the
course in which they ought to be read.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> The first book, Genesis, contains the most grand,
and, to us, the most interesting events, that ever happened in the
universe: The creation of the world, and of man; the deplorable
fall of man, from his first state of excellence and bliss, to the
distressed condition in which we see all his descendants continue:
The sentence of death pronounced on Adam and on all his race; with
the reviving promise of that deliverance, which has since been
wrought for us by our blessed Saviour: The account of the early
state of the world; of the universal deluge: The division of
mankind into different nations and languages: The story of Abraham,
the founder of the Jewish people, whose unshaken faith and
obedience, under the severest trial human nature could sustain,
obtained such favour in the sight of God, that he vouchsafed to
stile him his friend, and promised to make of his posterity a great
nation; and that in his seed&mdash;that is, in one of his
descendants&mdash;all the kingdoms of the earth should be blessed.
This, you will easily see, refers to the Messiah, who was to be the
blessing and deliverance of all nations.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> It is amazing that the Jews, possessing this prophecy
among many others, should have been so blinded by prejudice, as to
have expected from, this great personage, only a temporal
deliverance of their own nation from the subjection to which they
were reduced under the Romans: It is equally amazing, that some
Christians should, even now, confine the blessed effects of his
appearance upon earth, to this or that particular sect or
profession, when he is so clearly and emphatically described as the
Saviour of the whole world.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> The story of Abraham's proceeding to sacrifice his
only son, at the command of God, is affecting in the highest
degree, and sets forth a pattern of unlimited resignation, that
every one ought to imitate in those trials of obedience under
temptation, or of acquiescence under afflicting dispensations,
which fall to their lot: of this we may be assured, that our trials
will be always proportioned to the powers afforded us. If we have
not Abraham's strength of mind, neither shall we be called upon to
lift the bloody knife against the bosom of an only child; but, if
the almighty arm should be lifted up against him, we must be ready
to resign him, and all we hold dear, to the divine will.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> This action of Abraham has been censured by some who
do not attend to the distinction between obedience to a specified
command, and the detestably cruel sacrifices of the heathens, who
sometimes voluntarily, and without any divine injunctions, offered
up their own children, under the notion of appeasing the anger of
their gods. An absolute command from God himself&mdash;as in the
case of Abraham&mdash;entirely alters the moral nature of the
action; since he, and he only, has a perfect sight over the lives
of his creatures, and may appoint whom he will, either angel or
man, to be his instrument of destruction.</p>
<p><b>14.</b> That it was really the voice of God which pronounced
the command, and not a delusion, might be made certain to Abraham's
mind, by means we do not comprehend, but which we know to be within
the power of him who made our souls as well as bodies, and who can
control and direct every faculty of the human mind: and we may be
assured, that if he was pleased to reveal himself so miraculously,
he would not leave a possibility of doubting whether it was a real
or an imaginary revelation: thus the sacrifice of Abraham appears
to be clear of all superstition, and, remains the noblest instance
of religious faith and submission, that was ever given by a mere
man: we cannot wonder that the blessings bestowed on him for it,
should have been extended to his posterity.</p>
<p><b>15.</b> This book proceeds with the history of Isaac, which
becomes very interesting to us, from the touching scene I have
mentioned&mdash;and, still more so, if we consider him as the type
of our Saviour: it recounts his marriage with Rebecca&mdash;the
birth and history of his two sons, Jacob,&mdash;the father of the
twelve tribes, and Esau, the father of the Edomites or
Idumeans&mdash;the exquisitively affecting story of Joseph and his
brethren&mdash;and of his transplanting the Israelites into Egypt,
who there multiplied to a great nation.</p>
<br>
<a name='Of_Exodus' id="Of_Exodus"></a>
<h2><i>Of Exodus.</i></h2>
<p><b>16.</b> In Exodus, you read of a series of wonders, wrought
by the Almighty to rescue the oppressed Israelites from the cruel
tyranny of the Egyptians, who having first received them as guests,
by degrees reduced them to a state of slavery. By the most peculiar
mercies and exertion in their favour, God prepared his chosen
people to receive, with reverent and obedient hearts, the solemn
restitution of those primitive laws, which probably he had revealed
to Adam and his immediate descendants; or which, at least, he had
made known by the dictates of conscience, but which time, and the
degeneracy of mankind, had much obscured.</p>
<p><b>17.</b> This important revelation was made to them in the
wilderness of Sinai; there, assembled before the burning mountain,
surrounded with "blackness, and darkness, and tempest," they heard
the awful voice of God pronounce the eternal law, impressing it on
their hearts with circumstances of terror, but without those
encouragements and those excellent promises, which were afterwards
offered to mankind by Jesus Christ. Thus were the great laws of
morality restored to the Jews, and through them transmitted to
other nations; and by that means a great restraint was opposed to
the torrent of vice and impiety which began to prevail over the
world.</p>
<p><b>18.</b> To these moral precepts; which are of perpetual and
universal obligation, were superadded, by the ministration of
Moses, many peculiar institutions, wisely adapted to different
ends&mdash;either to fix the memory of those past deliverances,
which were figurative of a future and far greater
salvation&mdash;to place inviolable barriers between the Jews and
the idolatrous nations, by whom they were surrounded&mdash;or, to
be the civil law by which the community was to be governed.</p>
<p><b>19.</b> To conduct this series of events, and to establish
these laws with his people, God raised up that great prophet Moses,
whose faith and piety enabled him to undertake and execute the most
arduous enterprizes, and to pursue, with unabated zeal, the welfare
of his countrymen; even in the hour of death, this generous ardour
still prevailed; his last moments were employed in fervent prayers
for their prosperity, and, in rapturous gratitude, for the glimpse
vouchsafed him of a Saviour, far greater than himself, whom God
would one day raise up to his people.</p>
<p><b>20.</b> Thus did Moses, by the excellency of his faith,
obtain a glorious pre-eminence among the saints and prophets in
heaven; while on earth he will be for ever revered as the first of
those benefactors to mankind, whose labours for the public good
have endeared their memory to all ages.</p>
<br>
<a name='Of_Leviticus_Numbers_and_Deuteronomy' id=
"Of_Leviticus_Numbers_and_Deuteronomy"></a>
<h2><i>Of Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.</i></h2>
<p><b>21.</b> The next book is Leviticus, which contains little
besides the laws for the peculiar ritual observance of the Jews,
and therefore affords no great instruction to us now; you may pass
it over entirely; and for the same reason you may omit the first
eight chapters of Numbers. The rest of Numbers is chiefly a
continuation of the history, with some ritual laws.</p>
<p><b>22.</b> In Deuteronomy, Moses makes a recapitulation of the
foregoing history, with zealous exhortations to the people,
faithfully to worship and obey that God who had worked such amazing
wonders for them: he promises them the noblest temporal blessings,
if they prove obedient, and adds the most awful and striking
denunciations against them, if they rebel, or forsake the true
God.</p>
<p><b>23.</b> I have before observed, that the sanctions of the
Mosaic law, were temporal rewards and punishments; those of the New
Testament are eternal. These last, as they are so infinitely more
forcible than the first, were reserved for the last, best gift to
mankind&mdash;and were revealed by the Messiah, in the fullest and
clearest manner. Moses, in this book, directs the method in which
the Israelites were to deal with the seven nations, whom they were
appointed to punish for their profligacy and idolatry; and whose
land they were to possess, when they had driven out the old
inhabitants. He gives them excellent laws, civil as well as
religious, which were after the standing municipal laws of that
people. This book concludes with Moses' song and death.</p>
<br>
<a name='Of_Joshua' id="Of_Joshua"></a>
<h2><i>Of Joshua.</i></h2>
<p><b>24.</b> The book of Joshua contains the conquests of the
Israelites over the seven nations, and their establishment in the
promised land. Their treatment of these conquered nations must
appear to you very cruel and unjust, if you consider it as their
own act, unauthorised by a positive command; but they had the most
absolute injunctions not to spare these corrupt people&mdash;"to
make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy to them, but utterly to
destroy them:"&mdash;and the reason is given, "lest they should
turn away the Israelites from following the Lord, that they might
serve other gods." The children of Israel are to be considered as
instruments in the hand of the Lord, to punish those whose idolatry
and wickedness had deservedly brought destruction on them: this
example, therefore, cannot be pleaded in behalf of cruelty, or
bring any imputation on the character of the Jews.</p>
<p><b>25.</b> With regard to other cities, which did not belong to
these seven nations, they were directed to deal with them,
according to the common law of arms at that time. If the city
submitted, it became tributary, and the people were spared; if it
resisted, the men were to be slain, but the women and children
saved.</p>
<p><b>26.</b> Yet, though the crime of cruelty cannot be justly
laid to their charge on this occasion, you will observe in the
course of their history, many things recorded of them very
different from what you would expect from the chosen people of God,
if you supposed them selected on account of their own merit; their
national character was by no means amiable; and we are repeatedly
told, that they were not chosen for their superior
righteousness&mdash;"for they were a stiff-necked people, and
provoked the Lord with their rebellions from the day they left
Egypt."&mdash;"You have been rebellious against the Lord (says
Moses) from the day that I knew you." And he vehemently exhorts
them, not to flatter themselves that their success was, in any
degree, owing to their own merits.</p>
<p><b>27.</b> They were appointed to be the scourge of other
nations, whose crimes rendered them fit objects of divine
chastisement. For the sake of righteous Abraham, their founder, and
perhaps for many other wise reasons, undiscovered to us, they were
selected from a world over-run with idolatry, to preserve upon
earth the pure worship of the one only God, and to be honoured with
the birth of the Messiah amongst them. For this end, they were
precluded, by divine command, from mixing with any other people,
and defended, by a great number of peculiar rites and observances,
from falling into the corrupt worship practised by their
neighbours.</p>
<br>
<a name='Of_Judges_Samuel_and_Kings' id=
"Of_Judges_Samuel_and_Kings"></a>
<h2><i>Of Judges, Samuel, and Kings.</i></h2>
<p><b>28.</b> The book of Judges, in which you will find the
affecting stories of Sampson and Jeptha, carries on the history
from the death of Joshua, about two hundred and fifty years; but,
the facts are not told in the times in which they happened, which
makes some confusion; and it will be necessary to consult the
marginal dates and notes, as well as the index, in order to get any
clear idea of the succession of events during that period.</p>
<p><b>29.</b> The history then proceeds regularly through the two
books of Samuel, and those of Kings: nothing can be more
interesting and entertaining than the reigns of Saul, David, and
Solomon: but, after the death of Solomon, when ten tribes revolted
from his son Rehoboam, and became a separate kingdom, you will find
some difficulty in understanding distinctly the histories of the
two kingdoms of Israel and Judah, which are blended together, and
by the likeness of the names, and other particulars, will be apt to
confound your mind, without great attention to the different
threads thus carried on together: The index here will be of great
use to you. The second book of Kings concludes with the Babylonish
captivity, 588 years before Christ&mdash;'till which time the
kingdom of Judah had descended uninterruptedly in the line of
David.</p>
<br>
<a name='Of_Chronicles_Ezra_Nehemiah_and_Esther' id=
"Of_Chronicles_Ezra_Nehemiah_and_Esther"></a>
<h2><i>Of Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther.</i></h2>
<p><b>30.</b> The first book of Chronicles begins with a genealogy
from Adam, through all the tribes of Israel and Judah; and the
remainder is the same history which is contained in the books of
Kings, with little or no variation, till the separation of the ten
tribes: From that period it proceeds with the history of the
kingdom of Judah alone, and gives, therefore, a more regular and
clear account of the affairs of Judah, than the book of Kings. You
may pass over the first book of Chronicles, and the nine first
chapters of the second book: but, by all means, read the remaining
chapters, as they will give you more clear and distinct ideas of
the history of Judah, than that you read in the second book of
Kings. The second of Chronicles ends, like the second of Kings,
with the Babylonish captivity.</p>
<p><b>31.</b> You must pursue the history in the book of Ezra,
which gives the account of the return of some of the Jews on the
edict of Cyrus, and of the re-building the Lord's temple.</p>
<p><b>32.</b> Nehemiah carries on the history for about twelve
years, when he himself was governor of Jerusalem, with authority to
re-build the walls, &amp;c.</p>
<p><b>33.</b> The story of Esther is prior in time to that of Ezra
and Nehemiah; us you will see by the marginal dates; however, as it
happened during the seventy years captivity, and is a kind of
episode, it may be read in its own place.</p>
<p><b>34.</b> This is the last of the canonical books that is
properly historical; and I would therefore advise, that you pass
over what follows, till you have continued the history through the
Apocryphal Books.</p>
<br>
<a name='Of_Job' id="Of_Job"></a>
<h2><i>Of Job.</i></h2>
<p><b>35.</b> The history of Job is probably very ancient, though
that is a point upon which learned men have differed: It is dated,
however, 1520 years before Christ: I believe it is uncertain by
whom it was written: many parts of it are obscure, but it is well
worth studying, for the extreme beauty of the poetry, and for the
noble and sublime devotion it contains.</p>
<p><b>36.</b> The subject of the dispute between Job and his
pretended friends, seems to be, whether the Providence of God
distributes the rewards and punishments of this life; in exact
proportion to the merit or demerit of each individual. His
antagonists suppose that it does; and therefore infer from Job's
uncommon calamities, that, notwithstanding his apparent
righteousness, he was in reality a grievous sinner: They aggravate
his supposed guilt, by the imputation of hypocrisy, and call upon
him to confess it, and to acknowledge the justice of his
punishment.</p>
<p><b>37.</b> Job asserts his own innocence and virtue in the most
pathetic manner, yet does not presume to accuse the Supreme Being
of injustice. Elihu attempts to arbitrate the matter, by alledging
the impossibility that so frail and ignorant a creature as man
should comprehend the ways of the Almighty, and therefore condemns
the unjust and cruel inference the three friends had drawn from the
sufferings of Job. He also blames Job for the presumption of
acquitting himself of all iniquity, since the best of men are not
pure in the sight of God&mdash;but all have something to repent of;
and he advises him to make this use of his afflictions.</p>
<p><b>38.</b> At last, by a bold figure of poetry, the Supreme
Being himself is introduced, speaking from the whirlwind, and
silencing them all by the most sublime display of his own power,
magnificence, and wisdom, and of the comparative littleness and
ignorance of men.&mdash;This, indeed, is the only conclusion of the
argument, which could be drawn at a time when life and immortality
were not yet brought to light: a future retribution is the only
satisfactory solution of the difficulty arising from the sufferings
of good people in this life.</p>
<br>
<a name='Of_the_Psalms' id="Of_the_Psalms"></a>
<h2><i>Of the Psalms.</i></h2>
<p><b>39.</b> Next follow the Psalms, with which you cannot be too
conversant. If you have any taste, either for poetry or devotion,
they will be your delight, and will afford you a continual feast.
The Bible translation is far better than that used in the common
prayer-book, and will often give you the sense, when the other is
obscure. In this, as well as in all other parts of the scripture,
you must be careful always to consult the margin, which gives you
the corrections made since the last translation, and it is
generally preferable to the words of the text.</p>
<p><b>40.</b> I would wish you to select some of the Psalms that
please you best, and get them by heart; or, at least, make yourself
master of the sentiments contained in them: Dr. Delaney's life of
David, will shew you the occasions on which several of them were
composed, which add much to their beauty and propriety; and by
comparing them with the events of David's life, you will greatly
enhance your pleasure in them.</p>
<p><b>41.</b> Never did the spirit of true piety breathe more
strongly than in these divine songs; which being added to a rich
vein of poetry, makes them more captivating to my heart and
imagination, than any thing I ever read. You will consider how
great disadvantages any poem must sustain from being rendered
literally into prose, and then imagine how beautiful these must be
in the original.&mdash;May you be enabled by reading them
frequently, to transfuse into your own breast that holy flame which
inspired the writer!&mdash;To delight in the Lord, and in his laws,
like the Psalmist&mdash;to rejoice in him always, and to think "one
day in his courts better than a thousand!"&mdash;But may you escape
the heart-piercing sorrow of such repentance as that of
David&mdash;by avoiding sin, which humbled this unhappy king to the
dust&mdash;and which cost him such bitter anguish, as it is
impossible to read of without being moved.</p>
<p><b>42.</b> Not all the pleasures of the most prosperous sinners,
could counterbalance the hundredth part of those sensations
described in his penitential psalms&mdash;and which must be the
portion of every man, who has fallen from a religious state into
such crimes, when once he recovers a sense of religion and virtue,
and is brought to a real hatred of sin. However, available such
repentance may be to the safety and happiness of the soul after
death, it is a state of such exquisite suffering here, that one
cannot be enough surprised at the folly of those who indulge sin,
with the hope of living to make their peace with God by
repentance.</p>
<p><b>43.</b> Happy are they who preserve their innocence unsullied
by any great or wilful crimes, and who have only the common
failings of humanity to repent of, these are suffiently mortifying
to a heart deeply smitten with the love of virtue, and with the
desire of perfection.</p>
<p><b>44.</b> There are many very striking prophecies of the
Messiah in these divine songs, particularly in psalm xxii. Such may
be found scattered up and down almost throughout the Old Testament.
To bear testimony to <i>him</i>, is the great and ultimate end for
which the spirit of prophecy was bestowed on the sacred
writers;&mdash;but, this will appear more plainly to you when you
enter on the study of prophecy, which you are now much too young to
undertake.</p>

</a>
<h2><i>Of the Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Solomon's Song, the
Prophecies, and Apocrypha.</i></h2>
<p><b>45.</b> The Proverbs and Ecclesiastes are rich stores of
wisdom; from which I wish you to adopt such maxims as may be of
infinite use, both to your temporal and eternal interest. But,
detached sentences are a kind of reading not proper to be continued
long at a time; a few of them, well chosen and digested, will do
you much more service, than to read half a dozen chapters together:
in this respect, they are directly opposite to the historical
books, which, if not read in continuation, can hardly be
understood, or retained to any purpose.</p>
<p><b>46.</b> The Song of Solomon is a fine poem&mdash;but its
mystical reference to religion lies too deep for a common
understanding: if you read it, therefore, it will be rather as
matter of curiosity than of edification.</p>
<p><b>47.</b> Next follow the Prophecies; which, though highly
deserving the greatest attention and study, I think you had better
omit for some years, and then read them with a good Exposition, as
they are much too difficult for you to understand without
assistance. Dr. Newton on the prophecies, will help you much,
whenever you undertake this study; which you should by all means do
when your understanding is ripe enough; because one of the main
proofs of our religion rests on the testimony of the prophecies;
and they are very frequently quoted, and referred to, in the New
Testament: besides, the sublimity of the language and sentiments,
through all the disadvantages of a antiquity and translation, must,
in very many passages, strike every person of taste; and the
excellent moral and religious precepts found in them, must be
useful to all.</p>
<p><b>48.</b> Though I have spoken of these books in the order in
which they stand, I repeat, that they are not to be read in that
order&mdash;but that the thread of the history is to be pursued,
from Nehemiah to the first book of the Maccabees, in the Apocrypha;
taking care to observe the chronology regularly, by referring to
the index, which supplies the deficiencies of this history from
Josephus's Antiquities of the Jews. The first of Maccabees carries
on the story till within 195 years of our Lord's circumcision: the
second book is the same narrative, written by a different hand, and
does not bring the history so forward as the first; so that it may
be entirely omitted, unless you have the curiosity to read some
particulars of the heroic constancy of the Jews, under the tortures
inflicted by their heathen conquerors, with a few other things not
mentioned in the first book.</p>
<p><b>49.</b> You must then connect the history by the help of the
index, which will give you brief heads of the changes that happened
in the state of the Jews, from this time till the birth of the
Messiah.</p>
<p><b>50.</b> The other books of the Apocrypha, though not admitted
as of sacred authority, have many things well worth your attention;
particularly the admirable book called Ecclesiasticus, and the book
of Wisdom. But, in the course of reading which I advise, these must
be omitted till after you have gone through the Gospels and Acts,
that you may not lose the historical thread.</p>

</a>
<h2><i>Of the New Testament, which is constantly to be referred to
as the Rule and Direction of our moral Conduct.</i></h2>
<p><b>51.</b> We come now to that part of scripture, which is the
most important of all, and which you must make your constant study,
not only till you are thoroughly acquainted with but all your life
long; because, how often soever repeated, it is impossible to read
the life and death of our blessed Saviour, without renewing and
increasing in our hearts that love and reverence, and gratitude
towards him, which is so justly due for all he did and suffered for
us! Every word that fell from his lips is more precious than all
the treasures of the earth; for his "are the words of eternal
life!" They must therefore be laid up in your heart, and constantly
referred to on all occasions, as the rule and directions of all
your actions; particularly those very comprehensive moral precepts
he has graciously left with us, which can never fail to direct us
aright, if fairly and honestly applied: such as, "whatsoever you
would that men should do unto you, even so do unto them." There is
no occasion, great or small, on which you may not safely apply this
rule for the direction of your conduct; and, whilst your heart
honestly adheres to it, you can never be guilty of any sort of
injustice or unkindness.</p>
<p><b>52.</b> The two great commandments, which contain the summary
of our duty to God and man, are no less easily retained, and made a
standard by which to judge our own hearts&mdash;"To love the Lord
our God, with all our own hearts, with all our minds, with all our
strength; and our neighbour (or fellow-creature) as
ourselves."&mdash;"Love worketh no ill to his neighbour."
Therefore, if you have true benevolence, you will never do any
thing injurious to individuals, or to society.</p>
<p><b>53.</b> Now, all crimes whatever, are (in their remoter
consequences at least, if not immediately and apparently) injurious
to the society in which we live. It is impossible to love God
without desiring to please him, and, as far as we are able, to
resemble him: therefore the love of God must lead to every virtue
in the highest degree; and, we may be sure we do not truly love
him, if we content ourselves with avoiding flagrant sins, and do
not strive, in good earnest, to reach the greatest degree of
perfection we are capable of. Thus do these few words direct as to
the highest Christian virtue. Indeed; the whole tenor of the
Gospel, is to offer us every help, direction, and motive, that can
enable us to attain that degree of perfection on which depends our
eternal good.</p>

"Of_the_Example_set_by_our_Saviour_and_his_Character"></a>
<h2><i>Of the Example set by our Saviour, and his
Character.</i></h2>
<p><b>54.</b> What an example is set before us in our blessed
master! How is his whole life, from earliest youth, dedicated to
the pursuits of true wisdom, and to the practice of the most
exalted virtue! When you see him, at twelve years of age, in the
temple amongst the doctors, hearing them, and asking them questions
on the subject of religion, and astonishing them all with his
understanding and answers&mdash;you will say, perhaps, "Well might
the Son of God, even at those years, be far wiser than the aged;
but, can a mortal child emulate such heavenly wisdom! Can such a
pattern be proposed to my imitation?"&mdash;Yes,
certainly;&mdash;remember that he has bequeathed to you his
heavenly wisdom, as far as concerns your own good. He has left you
such declarations of his will, and of the consequences of your
actions, as you are, even now, fully able to understand, if you
will but attend to them. If, then, you will imitate his zeal for
knowledge, if you will delight in gaining information and
improvement, you may even now become "wise unto salvation."</p>
<p><b>55.</b> Unmoved by the praise he acquired amongst these
learned men, you see him meekly return to the subjection of a
child, under those who appeared to be his parents, though he was in
reality their Lord; you see him return to live with them, to work
for them, and to be the joy and solace of their lives; till the
time came, when he was to enter on that scene of public action, for
which his heavenly Father had sent him from his own right hand, to
take upon him the form of a poor carpenter's son.</p>
<p><b>56.</b> What a lesson of humility is this, and of obedience
to parents!&mdash;When, having received the glorious testimony from
heaven, of his being the beloved Son of the most High, he enters on
his public ministry, what an example does he give us, of the most
extensive and constant benevolence!&mdash;how are all his hours
spent in doing good to the souls and bodies of men!&mdash;not the
meanest sinner is below his notice:&mdash;To reclaim and save them,
he condescends to converse familiarly with the most corrupt as well
as the most abject. All his miracles are wrought to benefit
mankind; not one to punish and afflict them. Instead of using the
almighty power which accompanied him, to the purpose of exalting
himself, and treading down his enemies, he makes no other use of it
than to heal and to save.</p>
<p><b>57.</b> When you come to read of his sufferings and death,
the ignominy and reproach, the sorrow of mind, and torment of body,
which he submitted to&mdash;when you consider, that it was all for
our sakes&mdash;"that by his stripes we are healed,"&mdash;and by
his death we are raised from destruction to everlasting
life&mdash;what can I say that can add any thing to the sensations
you must then feel? No power of language can make the scene more
touching than it appears in the plain and simple narrations of the
Evangelists. The heart that is unmoved by it, can be scarcely
human; but the emotions of tenderness and compunction; which almost
every one feels in reading this account, will be of no avail,
unless applied to the true end&mdash;unless it inspires you with a
sincere and warm affection towards your blessed Lord&mdash;with a
firm resolution to obey his commands&mdash;to be his faithful
disciple&mdash;and ever renounce and abhor those sins, which
brought mankind under divine condemnation, and from which we have
been redeemed at so clear a rate.</p>
<p><b>58.</b> Remember that the title of Christian, or follower of
Christ, implies a more than ordinary degree of holiness and
goodness. As our motives to virtue are stronger than those which
are afforded to the rest of mankind, our guilt will be
proportionally greater if we depart from it.</p>
<p><b>59.</b> Our Saviour appears to have had three great purposes
in descending from his glory, and dwelling amongst men. The first,
to teach them true virtue, both by his example and precepts: the
second, to give them the most forcible motives to the practice of
it, by "bringing life and immortality to light;" by shewing them
the certainty of a resurrection and judgment, and the absolute
necessity of obedience to God's laws. The third, to sacrifice
himself for us, to obtain by his death the remission of our sins,
upon our repentance and reformation, and the power of bestowing on
his sincere followers, the inestimable gift of immortal
happiness.</p>

</a>
<h2><i>A Comparative View of the Blessed and Cursed at the Last
Day, and the Inference to be drawn from it.</i></h2>
<p><b>60.</b> What a tremendous scene of the last day does the
gospel place before our eyes!&mdash;of that day, when you and every
one of us shall awake from the grave, and behold the Son of God, on
his glorious tribunal, attended by millions of celestial beings, of
whose superior excellence we can now form no adequate
idea&mdash;When, in presence of all mankind, of those holy angels,
and of the great Judge himself, you must give an account of your
past life, and hear your final doom, from which there can be no
appeal, and which must determine your fate to all eternity: then
think&mdash;if for a moment you can hear the thought&mdash;what
will be the desolation, shame, and anguish of those wretched souls,
who shall hear these dreadful words&mdash;"Depart from me, ye
cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his
angels."&mdash;Oh!&mdash;I cannot support even the idea of your
becoming one of those undone, lost creatures! I trust in God's
mercy, that you will make a better use of that knowledge of his
will, which he has vouchsafed you, and of those amiable
dispositions he has given you.</p>
<p><b>61.</b> Let us, therefore, turn from this horrid, this
insupportable view&mdash;and rather endeavour to imagine, as far as
is possible, what will be the sensations of your soul, if you shall
hear our heavenly Judge address you in these transporting
words&mdash;"Come thou blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom
prepared for you from the foundation of the world."&mdash;Think,
what it must be, to become an object of the esteem and
applause&mdash;not only of all mankind assembled together&mdash;but
of all the host of heaven, of our blessed Lord himself&mdash;nay,
of his and our Almighty Father:&mdash;to find your frail flesh
changed in a moment into a glorious celestial body, endowed with
perfect beauty, health, and agility;&mdash;to find your soul
cleansed from all its faults and infirmities; exalted to the purest
and noblest affections; overflowing with divine love and rapturous
gratitude!&mdash;to have your understanding enlightened and
refined; your heart enlarged and purified; and every power, and
disposition of mind and body, adapted to the highest relish of
virtue and happiness!&mdash;Thus accomplished, to be admitted into
the society of amiable and happy beings, all united in the most
perfect peace and friendship, all breathing nothing but love to
God, and to each other;&mdash;with them to dwell in scenes more
delightful than the richest imagination can paint&mdash;free from
every pain and care, and from all possibility of change or
satiety:&mdash;but, above all, to enjoy the more immediate presence
of God himself&mdash;to be able to comprehend and admire his
adorable perfections in a high degree, though still far short of
their infinity&mdash;to be conscious, of his love and favour, and
to rejoice in the light of his countenance!</p>
<p><b>62.</b> But here all imagination fails:&mdash;we can form no
idea of that bliss which may be communicated to us by such a near
approach to the source of all beauty and all good:&mdash;we must
content ourselves with believing, "that it is what mortal eye hath
not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of
man to conceive." The crown of all our joys will be, to know that
we are secure of possessing them for ever&mdash;what a transporting
idea!</p>
<p><b>63.</b> Can you reflect on all these things, and not feel the
most earnest longings after immortality? Do not all other views and
desires seem mean and trifling, when compared with this?&mdash;And
does not your inmost heart resolve, that this shall be the chief
and constant object of its wishes and pursuit, through the whole
course of your life?</p>
<p><b>64.</b> If you are not insensible to that desire of happiness
which seems woven into our nature, you cannot surely be unmoved by
the prospect of such a transcendant degree of it; and
that&mdash;continued to all eternity&mdash;perhaps continually
increasing. You cannot but dread the forfeiture of such an
inheritance as the most insupportable evil!&mdash;Remember
then&mdash;remember the conditions on which alone it can be
obtained. God will not give to vice, to carelessness, or sloth, the
prize he has proposed to virtue. You have every help that can
animate your endeavours: You have written laws to direct
you&mdash;the example of Christ and his disciples to encourage
you&mdash;the most awakening motives to engage you&mdash;and you
have, besides, the comfortable promise of constant assistance from
the Holy Spirit, if you diligently and sincerely pray for it. O!
let not all this mercy be lost upon you&mdash;but give your
attention to this your only important concern, and accept, with
profound gratitude, the inestimable advantages that are thus
affectionately offered you.</p>
<p><b>65.</b> Though the four Gospels are each of them a narration
of the life, sayings, and death of Christ; yet as they are not
exactly alike, but some circumstances and sayings omitted in one,
are recorded in another, you must make yourself perfectly master of
them all.</p>
<p><b>66.</b> The Acts of the Holy Apostles, endowed with the Holy
Ghost, and authorised by their Divine Master, come next in order to
be read. Nothing can be more interesting and edifying, than the
history of their actions&mdash;of the piety, zeal, and courage,
with which they preached the glad tidings of salvation, and of the
various exertions of the wonderful powers conferred on them by the
Holy Spirit for the confirmation of their mission.</p>
<a name='Character_of_St_Paul' id="Character_of_St_Paul"></a>
<h2><i>Character of St. Paul.</i></h2>
<p><b>67.</b> The character of St. Paul, and his miraculous
conversion, demand your particular attention: most of the Apostles
were men of low birth and education; but St. Paul was a Roman
citizen; that is, he possessed the privileges annexed to the
freedom of the city of Rome, which was considered as a high
distinction in those countries that had been conquered by the
Romans. He was educated amongst the most learned sect of the Jews,
and by one of their principal doctors. He was a man of
extraordinary eloquence, as appears not only in his writings, but
in several speeches in his own defence, pronounced before governors
and courts of justice, when he was called to account for the
doctrines he taught.</p>
<p><b>68.</b> He seems to have been of an uncommonly warm temper,
and zealous in whatever religion he professed: his zeal, before his
conversion, shewed itself in the most unjustifiable actions, by
furiously persecuting the innocent Christians: but, though his
actions were bad, we may be sure his intentions were good;
otherwise we should not have seen a miracle employed to convince
him of his mistake, and to bring him into the right way.</p>
<p><b>69.</b> This example may assure us of the mercy of God
towards mistaken consciences, and ought to inspire us with the most
enlarged charity and good will towards those whose erroneous
principles mislead their conduct: instead of resentment and hatred
against their persons, we ought only to feel an active wish of
assisting them to find the truth, since we know not whether, if
convinced, they might not prove, like St. Paul, chosen vessels to
promote the honour of God, and of true religion.</p>
<p><b>70.</b> It is not now my intention to enter with you into any
of the arguments for the truth of Christianity, otherwise it would
be impossible wholly to pass over that which arises from this
remarkable conversion, and which has been so admirably illustrated
by a nobler writer, whose tract on this subject is in everybody's
hands.</p>
<br>
<a name='Of_the_Epistles' id="Of_the_Epistles"></a>
<h2><i>Of the Epistles.</i></h2>
<p><b>71.</b> Next follow the Epistles, which make a very important
part of the New Testament; and you cannot be too much employed in
reading them. They contain the most excellent precepts and
admonitions; and are of particular use in explaining more at large
several doctrines of Christianity, which we could not so fully
comprehend without them.</p>
<p><b>72.</b> There are indeed, in the Epistles of St. Paul, many
passages hard to be understood: such in particular are the first
eleven chapters to the Romans; the greater part of his Epistles to
the Corinthians and Galatians; and several chapters of that to the
Hebrews. Instead of perplexing yourself with these more obscure
passages of scripture, I would wish you to employ your attention
chiefly on those that are plain; and to judge of the doctrines
taught in the other parts, by comparing them with what you find in
these. It is through the neglect of this rule, that many have been
led to draw the most absurd doctrines from the Holy Scriptures.</p>
<p><b>73.</b> Let me particularly recommend to your careful
perusal, the xii, xiii, xiv, and xv chapters of the Epistle to the
Romans. In the xiv chapter, St. Paul has in view the difference
between the Jewish and Gentile (or Heathen) converts at that time;
the former were disposed to look with horror on the latter, for
their impiety in not paying the same regard to the distinctions of
days and meats that they did; and the latter, on the contrary, were
inclined to look with contempt on the former, for their weakness
and superstition.</p>
<p><b>74.</b> Excellent is the advice which the Apostle gives to
both parties: he exhorts the Jewish converts not to judge and the
Gentiles not to despise; remembering that the kingdom of Heaven is
not meat and drink, but righteousness and peace, and joy in the
Holy Ghost.</p>
<p><b>75.</b> Endeavour to conform yourself to this advice; to
acquire a temper of universal candour and benevolence; and learn
neither to despise nor condemn any persons on account of their
particular modes of faith and worship: remembering always, that
goodness is confined to no party, that there are wise and worthy
men among all the sects of Christians, and that to his own master
every one must stand or fall.</p>
<p><b>76.</b> I will enter no farther into the several points
discussed by St. Paul in his various epistles; most of them are too
intricate for your understanding at present, and many of them
beyond my abilities to state clearly. I will only again recommend
to you, to read those passages frequently, which, with, so much
fervor and energy, excite you to the practice of the most exalted
piety and benevolence. If the effusions of a heart, warmed with the
tenderest affection for the whole human race; if precept, warning,
encouragement, example, urged by an eloquence which such affection
only could inspire, are capable of influencing your mind; you
cannot fail to find, in such parts of his epistles as are adapted
to your understanding, the strongest persuasives to every virtue
that can adorn and improve your nature.</p>
<br>
<a name='The_Epistle_of_St_James' id="The_Epistle_of_St_James"></a>
<h2><i>The Epistle of St. James.</i></h2>
<p><b>77.</b> The Epistle of St. James is entirely practical, and
exceedingly fine; you cannot study it too much. It seems
particularly designed to guard Christians against misunderstanding
some things in St. Paul's writings, which have been fatally
perverted to the encouragement of a dependence on faith alone,
without good works. But, the more rational commentators will tell
you, that by the works of the law, which the Apostle asserts to be
incapable of justifying us, he means not the works of moral
righteousness, but the ceremonial works of the Mosaic law; on which
the Jews laid the greatest stress as necessary to salvation. But,
St. James tells us, "that if any man among us seem to be religious,
and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, that
man's religion is vain;"&mdash;and that "pure religion, and
undefiled before God and the Father, is this, to visit the
fatherless and widow in their affliction, and to keep himself
unspotted from the world." Faith in Christ, if it produce not these
effects, he declareth is dead, or of no power.</p>

<h2><i>Epistles of St. Peter, and the first of St. John.</i></h2>
<p><b>78.</b> The Epistles of St. Peter are also full of the best
instructions and admonitions, concerning the relative duties of
life; amongst which are set forth the duties of women in general,
and of wives in particular. Some part of his second Epistle is
prophetical; warning the church of false teachers and false
doctrines, which undermine morality, and disgrace the cause of
Christianity.</p>
<p><b>79.</b> The first of St. John is written in a highly
figurative stile, which makes it in some parts hard to be
understood: but the spirit of divine love which it so fervently
expresses, renders it highly edifying and delightful.&mdash;That
love of God and of Man, which this beloved apostle so pathetically
recommends, is in truth the essence of religion as our Saviour
himself informs us.</p>
<br>
<a name='Of_the_Revelations' id="Of_the_Revelations"></a>
<h2><i>Of the Revelations.</i></h2>
<p><b>80.</b> The book of Revelations contains a prophetical
account of most of the greater events relating to the Christian
church, which were to happen from the time of the writer, St. John,
to the end of the world. Many learned men have taken a great deal
of pains to explain it; and they have done this in many instances
very successfully; but, I think, it is yet too soon for you to
study this part of scripture: some years hence, perhaps, there may
be no objection to your attempting it, and taking into your hands
the best Expositions to assist you in reading such of the most
difficult parts of the New Testament as you cannot now be supposed
to understand.&mdash;May heaven direct you in studying this sacred
volume, and render it the means of making you wise unto
salvation!&mdash;-May you love and reverence, as it deserves, this
blessed and valuable book, which contains the best rule of life,
the clearest declaration of the will and laws of the Deity, the
reviving assurance of favour to true penitants, and the unspeakable
joyful tidings of eternal life and happiness to all the truly
virtuous, through Jesus Christ, the Saviour and Deliverer of the
world.</p>

<h2><i>True Devotion productive of the truest Pleasure</i>.</h2>
<p><b>1.</b> You see that true devotion is not a melancholy
sentiment, that depresses the spirits and excludes the ideas, of
pleasure, which youth is so fond of: on the contrary, there is
nothing so friendly to joy, so productive of true pleasure, so
peculiarly suited to the warmth and innocence of a youthful heart.
Do not, therefore, think it too soon to turn your mind to God; but
offer him, the first fruits of your understanding and affections:
and, be assured, that the more you increase in love to him, and
delight in his laws, the more you will increase in happiness, in
excellence, and honour:&mdash;that, in proportion as you improve in
true piety, you will become dear and amiable to your fellow
creatures; contented and peaceable in yourself, and qualified to
enjoy the best blessings of this life, as well as to inherit the
glorious promise of immortality.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> Thus far I have spoken of the first principles of all
religion: namely, belief in God, worthy notions of his attributes,
and suitable affections towards him&mdash;which will naturally
excite a sincere desire of obedience. But, before you can obey his
will, you must know what that will is; you must enquire in what
manner he has declared it, and where you may find those laws, which
must be the rule of your actions.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> The great laws of morality are indeed written in our
hearts, and may be discovered by reason; but our reason is of slow
growth, very unequally dispensed to different persons; liable to
error, and confined within very narrow limits in all. If,
therefore, God has vouchsafed to grant a particular revelation of
his will&mdash;if he has been so unspeakably gracious as to send
his Son into the world, to reclaim mankind from error and
wickedness&mdash;to die for our sins&mdash;and to teach us the way
to eternal life&mdash;surely it becomes us to receive his precepts
with the deepest reverence; to love and prize them above all
things; and to study them constantly, with an earnest desire to
conform our thoughts, our words and actions, to them.</p>

<p>Father of all! we return thee most humble and hearty thanks for
thy protection of us in the night season, and for the refreshment
of our souls and bodies, in the sweet repose of sleep. Accept also
our unfeigned gratitude for all thy mercies during the helpless age
of infancy.</p>
<p>Continue, we beseech thee, to guard us under the shadow of thy
wing. Our age is tender, and our nature frail, and without the
influence of thy grace, we shall surely fall.</p>
<p>Let that influence descend into our hearts, and teach us to love
thee and truth above all things. O guard our hearts from the
temptations to deceit, and grant, that we may abhor a lie as a sin
and as a disgrace.</p>
<p>Inspire us also with an abhorrence of the loathsomeness of vice,
and the pollutions of sensual pleasure. Grant at the same time,
that we may early feel the delight of conscious purity, and wash
our hands in innocency, from the united motives of inclination and
of duty.</p>
<p>Give us, O thou Parent of all knowledge, a love of learning, and

Improve our memory, quicken our apprehension, and grant that we may
lay up such a store of learning, as may fit us for the station to
which it shall please thee to call us, and enable us to make great
advances in virtue and religion, and shine as lights in the world,
by the influence of a good example.</p>
<p>Give us grace to be diligent in our studies, and that whatever
we read we may strongly mark, and inwardly digest it.</p>
<p>Bless our parents, guardians, and instructors; and grant that we
may make them the best return in our power, for giving us
opportunities of improvement, and for all their care and attention
to our welfare. They ask no return, but that we should make use of
those opportunities, and co-operate with their endeavours&mdash;O
grant that we may never disappoint their anxious expectations.</p>
<p>Assist us mercifully, O Lord, that we may immediately engage in
the studies and duties of the day, and go through them cheerfully,
diligently and successfully.</p>

<p>O almighty God! again we approach thy mercy-seat, to offer unto
thee our thanks and praises for the blessings and protection
afforded us this day; and humbly to implore thy pardon for our
manifold transgressions.</p>
<p>Grant that the words of various instruction which we have heard

thee, O Lord, and for whatever is excellent and beautiful in
learning and behaviour.</p>
<p>Correct, by the sweet influence of Christian charity, the

hoping by thy mercy to rise again with renewed spirits, to go
through the business of the morrow, and to prepare ourselves for
this life, and for a blessed immortality; which we ardently hope to
attain, through the merits and intercession of thy Son our Saviour,

"Of_Columbus_and_the_Discovery_of_America"></a>
<h2><i>Of Columbus, and the Discovery of America.</i></h2>
<p><b>1.</b> It is to the discoveries of the Portuguese in the old
world, that we are indebted for the new, if we may call the
conquest of America an obligation, which proved so fatal to its
inhabitants, and at times to the conquerors themselves.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> This was doubtless the most important event that ever
happened on our globe, one half of which had been hitherto
strangers to the other. Whatever had been esteemed most great or
noble before, seemed absorbed in this kind of new creation. We
still mention, with respectful admiration, the names of the
Argonauts, who did not perform the hundredth part of what was done
by the sailors under Gama and Albuquerque. How many altars would
have been raised by the ancients to a Greek who had discovered
America! and yet Bartholomew and Christopher Columbus were not thus
rewarded.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> Columbus, struck with the wonderful expeditions of the
Portuguese, imagined that something greater might be done; and from
a bare inspection of the map of our world, concluded that there
must be another which might be found by sailing always west. He had
courage equal to his genius, or indeed superior, seeing he had to
struggle with the prejudices of his cotemporaries, and the repulses
of several princes to whom he had tendered his services.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> Genoa, which was his native country, treated his
schemes as visionary, and by that means lost the only opportunity
that could have offered of aggrandizing her power. Henry VII. king
of England, who was too greedy of money, to hazard any on this
noble attempt, would not listen to the proposals made by Columbus's
brother; and Columbus himself was rejected by John II. of Portugal,
whose attention was wholly employed upon the coast of Africa. He
had no prospect of success in applying to the French, whose marine
lay totally neglected, and their affairs more confused than ever,
daring the Minority of Charles VIII. The emperor Maximilian, had
neither ports for shipping, money to fit out a fleet, nor
sufficient courage to engage in a scheme of this nature. The
Venetians, indeed, might have undertaken it; but whether the
natural aversion of the Genoese to these people, would not suffer
Columbus to apply to the rivals of his country, or that the
Venetians had no idea of any thing more important than the trade
they carried on from Alexandria and in the Levant, Columbus at
length fixed all his hopes on the court of Spain.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> Ferdinand, king of Arragon, and Isabella, queen of
Castile, had by their marriage united all Spain under one dominion,
excepting only the kingdom of Granada, which was still in the
possession of the Moors; but which Ferdinand soon after took from
them. The union of these two princes had prepared the way for the
greatness of Spain, which was afterwards begun by Columbus; he was
however obliged to undergo eight years of incessant application,
before Isabella's court would consent to accept of the inestimable
benefit this great man offered it. The bane of all great objects is
the want of money. The Spanish court was poor; and the prior,
Perez, and two merchants, named Pinzono, were obliged to advance
seventeen thousand ducats towards fitting out the armament.
Columbus procured a patent from the court, and at length set sail
from the port of Palos, in Andalusia, with three ships, on August
23, in the year 1492.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> It was not above a month after his departure from the
Canary Islands, where he had come to an anchor to get refreshment,
when Columbus discovered the first island in America; and during
this short run, he suffered more from the murmurings and discontent
of the people of his fleet, than he had done even from the refusals
of the princes he had applied to. This island, which he discovered
and named St. Salvador, lies about a thousand leagues from the
Canaries. Presently after he likewise discovered the Lucayan
islands, together with those of Cuba and Hispaniola, now called St.
Domingo.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> Ferdinand and Isabella were in the utmost surprise to
see him return at the end of nine months, with some of the American
natives of Hispaniola, several rarities from that country, and a
quantity of gold, with which he presented their majesties.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> The king and queen made him sit down in their
presence, covered like a grandee of Spain, and created him high
admiral and viceroy of the new world. Columbus was now every where
looked upon as an extraordinary person sent from heaven. Everyone
was vying who should be foremost in assisting him in his
undertakings, and embarking under his command. He soon set sail
again, with a fleet of seventeen ships. He now made the discovery
of several other new islands, particularly the Caribees and
Jamaica. Doubt had been changed into admiration on his first
voyage; in this, admiration was turned into envy.</p>
<p><b>9.</b> He was admiral and viceroy, and to these titles might
have been added that of the benefactor of Ferdinand and Isabella.
Nevertheless, he was brought home prisoner to Spain, by judges who
had been purposely sent out on board to observe his conduct. As
soon as it was known that Columbus was arrived, the people ran in
shoals to meet him, as the guardian genius of Spain. Columbus was
brought from the ship, and appeared on shore chained hands and
feet.</p>
<p><b>10.</b> He had been thus treated by the orders of Fonseca,
Bishop of Burgos, the intendant of the expedition, whose
ingratitude was as great as the other's services. Isabella was
ashamed of what she saw, and did all in her power to make Columbus
amends for the injuries done to him: however he was not suffered to
depart for four years, either because they feared that he would
seize upon what he had discovered for himself, or that they were
willing to have time to observe his behaviour. At length he was
sent on another voyage to the new world; and now it was that he
discovered the continent, at six degrees distance from the equator,
and saw that part of the coast on which Carthagena has been since
built.</p>
<p><b>11.</b> At the time that Columbus first promised a new
hemisphere, it was insisted upon that no such hemisphere could
exist; and after he had made the actual discovery of it, it was
pretended that it had been known long before.</p>
<p><b>12.</b> I shall not mention one Martin Behem, of Nuremberg,
who, it is said, went from that city to the Straits of Magellan, in
1460, with a patent from the Duchess of Burgundy, who, as she was
not alive at that time, could not issue patents. Nor shall I take
notice of the pretended charts of this Martin Behem, which are
still shewn; nor of the evident contradictions which discredit this
story: but, in short, it was not pretended that Martin Behem had
peopled America; the honour was given to the Carthaginians, and a
book of Aristotle was quoted on the occasion, which he never wrote.
Some found out a conformity between some words in the Caribee and
Hebrew languages, and did not fail to follow so fine an opening.
Others were positive that the children of Noah, after settling in
Siberia, passed from thence over to Canada on the ice, and that
their descendants, afterwards born in Canada, had gone and peopled
Peru. According to others again, the Chinese and Japanese sent
colonies into America, and carried over lions with them for their
diversion, though there are no lions either in China or Japan.</p>
<p><b>13.</b> In this manner have many learned men argued upon the
discoveries made by men of genius. If it should be asked, how men
first came upon the continent of America? Is it not easily
answered, that they were placed there by the same power who causes
trees and grass to grow?</p>
<p><b>14.</b> The reply which Columbus made to some of those who
envied him the high reputation he had gained, is still famous.
These people pretended that nothing could be more easy than the
discoveries he had made; upon which he proposed to them to set an
egg upright on one of its ends; but when they had tried in vain to
do it, he broke one end of the egg, and set it upright with ease.
They told him any one could do that: How comes it then, replied
Columbus, that not one among you thought of it? This story is
related of Brunelleschi, who improved architecture at Florence many
years before Columbus was born. Most bon-mots are only the
repetition of things that have been said before.</p>
<p><b>15.</b> The ashes of Columbus cannot be affected by the
reputation he gained while living, in having doubled for us the
works of the creation. But mankind delight to do justice to the
illustrious dead, either from a vain hope that they enhance thereby
the merit of the living, or that they are naturally fond of
truth.</p>
<p><b>16.</b> Americo Vespucci, whom we call Americus Vespusius, a
merchant of Florence, had the honour of giving his name to this new
half of the globe, in which he did not possess one acre of land,
and pretended to be the first who discovered the continent. But
supposing it true, that he was the first discoverer, the glory was
certainly due to him who had the penetration and courage to
undertake and perform the first voyage: Honour, as Newton says in
his dispute with Leibnitz, is due only to the first inventor; and
those that follow after are only his scholars.</p>
<p><b>17.</b> Columbus had made three voyages as admiral and
viceroy, five years before Americas Vespusius had made one as a
geographer, under the command of admiral Ojeda; but the latter,
writing to his friends at Florence, that he had discovered a new
world, they believed him on his word, and the citizens of Florence
decreed, that a grand illumination should be made before the door
of his house every three years, on the feast of All Saints. And
yet, could this man be said to deserve any honours, for happening
to be on board a fleet that, in 1489; sailed along the coast of
Brazil, when Columbus had, five years before, pointed out the way
to the rest of the world?</p>
<p><b>18.</b> There has lately appeared at Florence, a life of this
Americus Vespusius, which seems to be written with very little
regard to truth, and without any conclusive reasoning. Several
French authors are there complained of, who have done justice to
Columbus's merit; but the writer should not have fallen upon the
French authors, but on the Spanish, who were the first that did
this justice. This writer says, "that he will confound the vanity
of the French nation, who have always attacked with impunity the
honour and success of the Italian nation."</p>
<p><b>19.</b> What vanity can there be in saying, that it was a
Genoese that first discovered America? or how is the honour of the
Italian nation injured in owning, that it was to an Italian born in
Genoa, that we are indebted for the new world? I purposely remark
this want of equity, good breeding, and good sense, as we have too
many examples of it; and I must say, that the good French writers
have in general been the least guilty of this insufferable fault;
and one great reason of their being so universally read throughout
Europe, is their doing justice to all nations.</p>
<p><b>20.</b> The inhabitants of these islands, and of the
continent, were a new race of men. They were all without beards,
and were as much astonished at the faces of the Spaniards, as they
were at their ships and artillery: they at first looked upon these
new visitors as monsters or gods, who had come out of the sky or
the sea.</p>
<p><b>21.</b> These voyages, and those of the Portuguese, had now
taught us how inconsiderable a spot of the globe our Europe was,
and what an astonishing variety reigns in the world. Indostan was
known to be inhabited by a race of men whose complexions were
yellow. In Africa and Asia, at some distance from the equator,
there had been found several kinds of black men; and after
travellers had penetrated into America, as far as the line, they
met with a race of people who were tolerably white. The natives of
Brazil are of the colour of bronze. The Chinese still appear to
differ entirely from the rest of mankind, in the make of their eyes
and noses. But what is still to be remarked is, that into
whatsoever regions these various races are transplanted, their
complexions never change, unless they mingle with the natives of
the country. The mucous membrane of the negroes, which is known to
be of a black colour, is a manifest proof, that there is a
differential principle in each species of men, as well as
plants.</p>
<p><b>22.</b> Dependent upon this principle, nature has formed the
different degrees of genius, and the characters of nations, which
are seldom known to change. Hence the negroes are slaves to other
men, and are purchased on the coast of Africa like beasts, for a
sum of money; and the vast multitudes of negroes transplanted into
our American colonies, serve as slaves under a very inconsiderable
number of Europeans. Experience has likewise taught us how great a
superiority the Europeans have over the Americans, who are every
where easily overcome, and have not dared to attempt a revolution,
though a thousand to one superior in numbers.</p>
<p><b>23.</b> This part of America was also remarkable on account
of its animals and plants, which are not to be found in the other
three parts of the world, and which are of so great use to us.
Horses, corn of all kinds, and iron, were not wanting in Mexico and
Peru, and among the many valuable commodities unknown to the old
world, cochineal was the principal, and was brought us from this
country. Its use in dying has now made us forget the scarlet, which
for time immemorial had been the only thing known for giving a fine
red colour.</p>
<p><b>24.</b> The importation of cochineal was soon succeeded by
that of indigo, cocoa, vanille, and those woods which serve for
ornament and medicinal purposes, particularly the quinquina, or
Jesuit's bark, which is the only specific against intermitting
fevers. Nature has placed this remedy in the mountains of Peru,
whilst she had dispersed the disease it cured through all the rest
of the world. This new continent likewise furnished pearls;
coloured stones, and diamonds.</p>
<p><b>25.</b> It is certain, that America at present furnishes the
meanest citizen of Europe with his conveniences and pleasures. The
gold and silver mines, at their first discovery, were of service
only to the kings of Spain and the merchants; the rest of the world
was impoverished by them; for the great multitudes who did not
follow business, found themselves possessed of a very small
quantity of specie, in comparison with the immense sums accumulated
by those who had the advantage of the first discoveries. But, by
degrees, the great quantity of gold and silver which was sent from
America, was dispersed throughout all Europe, and by passing into a
number of hands, the distribution is become more equal. The price
of commodities is likewise increased in Europe, in proportion to
the increase of specie.</p>
<p><b>26.</b> To comprehend how the treasures of America passed
from the possession of the Spaniards into that of other nations, it
will be sufficient to consider these two things: The use which
Charles V. and Philip II. made of their money; and the manner in
which other nations acquired a share in the mines of Peru.</p>
<p><b>37.</b> The emperor Charles V. who was always travelling, and
always at war, necessarily dispersed a great quantity of that
specie which he received from Mexico and Peru, through Germany and
Italy. When he sent his son Philip over to England, to marry queen
Mary, and take upon bun the title of king of England, that prince
deposited in the tower of London, twenty-seven large chests of
silver, in bars, and an hundred horse-loads of gold and silver
coin. The troubles in Flanders, and the intrigues of the league in
France, cost this Philip, according to his own confession, above
three thousand millions of livres of our money.</p>
<p><b>28.</b> The manner in which the gold and silver of Peru is
distributed amongst all the people of Europe, and from thence is
sent to the East-Indies, is a surprising, though well-known
circumstance. By a strict law enacted by Ferdinand and Isabella,
and afterwards confirmed by Charles V. and all the kings of Spain,
all other nations were not only excluded the entrance into any of
the ports in Spanish America, but likewise from having the least
share, directly or indirectly, in the trade of that part of the
world. One would have imagined, that this law would have enabled
the Spaniards to subdue all Europe; and yet Spain subsists only by
the continual violation of this very law. It can hardly furnish
exports for America to the value of four millions; whereas the rest
of Europe sometimes send over merchandize to the amount of near
fifty millions.</p>
<p><b>29.</b> This prodigious trade of the nations at enmity, or at
alliance with Spain, is carried on by the Spaniards themselves, who
are always faithful in their dealings with individuals, and always
cheating their king. The Spaniards gave no security to foreign
merchants for the performance of their contracts; a mutual credit,
without which there never could have been any commerce, supplies
the place of other obligations.</p>
<p><b>30.</b> The manner in which the Spaniards for a long time
consigned the gold and silver to foreigners, which was brought home
by their galleons, was still more surprising. The Spaniard, who at
Cadiz is properly factor for the foreigner, delivered the bullion
he received to the care of certain bravoes, called Meteors: these,
armed with pistols at their belt, and a long sword, carried the
bullion in parcels, properly marked, to the ramparts, and flung
them over to other meteors, who waited below, and carried them to
the boats which were to receive them, and these boats carried them
on board the ships in the road. These meteors and the factors,
together with the commissaries and the guards; who never disturbed
them, had each a stated fee, and the foreign merchant was never
cheated. The king, who received a duty upon this money at the
arrival of the galleons, was likewise a gainer; so that properly
speaking, the law only was cheated; a law which would be absolutely
useless if not eluded, and which, nevertheless, cannot yet be
abrogated, because old prejudices are always the most difficult to
be overcome amongst men.</p>
<p><b>31.</b> The greatest instance of the violation of this law,
and of the fidelity of the Spaniards, was in the year 1684, when
war was declared between France and Spain. His Catholic majesty
endeavoured to seize upon the effects of all the French in his
kingdom; but he in vain issued edicts and admonitions, enquiries
and excommunications, not a single Spanish factor would betray his
French correspondent. This fidelity, which does so much honour to
the Spanish nation, plainly shews, that men only willingly obey
those laws which they themselves have made for this good of
society, and that those which are the mere effects of a sovereign's
will, always meet with opposition.</p>
<p><b>32.</b> As the discovery of America was at first the source
of much good to the Spaniards, it afterwards occasioned them many
and considerable evils. One has been, the depriving that kingdom of
its subjects, by the great numbers necessarily required to people
the colonies: another was, the infecting the world with a disease,
which was before unknown only in the new world and particularly in
the island of Hispaniola. Several of the companions of Christopher
Columbus returned home infected with this contagion, which
afterwards spread over Europe. It is certain that this poison,
which taints the springs of life, was peculiar to America, as the
plague and small-pox, were diseases originally endemial to the
southern parts of Numidia.</p>
<p><b>33.</b> We are not to believe, that the eating of human
flesh, practised by some of the American savages, occasions this
disorder. There were no cannibals on the island of Hispaniola,
where it was most frequent and inveterate; neither are we to
suppose, with some, that it proceeded from too great an excess of
sensual pleasures. Nature had never punished excesses of this kind
with such disorders in the world; and even to this day, we find
that a momentary indulgence, which has been passed for eight or ten
years, may bring this cruel and shameful scourge upon the chastest
union.</p>
<p><b>34.</b> The great Columbus, after having built several houses
on these islands, and discovered the continent, returned to Spain,
where he enjoyed a reputation unsullied by rapine or cruelty, and
died at Validolid in 1506. But the Governors of Cuba and
Hispaniola, who succeeded him, being persuaded that these provinces
furnished gold, resolved to make the discovery at the price of the
lives of the inhabitants. In short, whether they thought the
natives had conceived an implacable hatred to them, or that they
were apprehensive of their superior numbers; or that the rage of
slaughter when once begun, knows no bounds, they in the space of a
few years entirely depopulated Hispaniola and Cuba, the former of
which contained three millions of inhabitants, and the latter above
six hundred thousand.</p>
<p><b>35.</b> Bartholomew de la Cases, bishop of Chiapa, who was an
eye-witness to these desolations, relates that they hunted down the
natives with dogs. These wretched savages, almost naked and without
arms, were pursued like wild beasts in the forest, devoured alive
by dogs, shot to death, or surprised and burnt in their
habitations.</p>
<p><b>36.</b> He further declares, from occular testimony, that
they frequently caused a number of these miserable wretches to be
summoned by a priest to come in, and submit to the Christian
religion, and to the king of Spain; and that after this ceremony,
which was only an additional act of injustice, they put them to
death without the least remorse.&mdash;I believe that De la Cases
has exaggerated in many parts of his relation; but, allowing him to
have said ten times more than is truth, there remains enough to
make us shudder with horror.</p>
<p><b>37.</b> It may seem surprizing, that this massacre of a whole
race of men, could have been carried on in the sight, and under the
administration of several religieuse of the order of St. Jerome;
for we know that cardinal Ximenes, who was prime minister at
Castile before the time of Charles V. sent over four monks of this
order, in quality of presidents of the royal council of the island.
Doubtless they were not able to resist the torrent, and the hatred
of the natives to their new masters being with just reason become
implacable, rendered their destruction unhappily necessary.</p>

<h3><b>Romulus <i>the founder of Rome, after building the city,
resolved to submit the form of its government to the choice of the
people; and therefore, calling the citizens together, he harangued
them thus</i>:</b></h3>
<p>If all the strength of cities lay in the height of their
ramparts, or the depth of their ditches, we should have great
reason to be in fear for that which we have now built. Are there in
reality any walls too high to be scaled by a valiant enemy? And of
what use are ramparts in intestine divisions? They may serve for a
defence against sudden incursions from abroad; but it is by courage
and prudence chiefly, that the invasions of foreign enemies are
repelled; and by unanimity, sobriety, and justice, that domestic
seditions are prevented. Cities fortified by the strongest
bulwarks, have been often seen to yield to force from without, or
to tumults from within. An exact military discipline, and a steady
observance of civil polity, are the surest barriers against these
evils. But there is still another point of great importance to be
considered. The prosperity of some rising colonies, and the speedy
ruin of others, have in a great measure been owing to the form of
government. Was there but one manner of ruling states and cities
that could make you happy, the choice would not be difficult; but I
have learnt, that of the various forms of government among the
Greeks and Barbarians, there are three which are highly extolled by
those who have experienced them; and yet, that no one in those is
in all respects perfect; but each of them has some innate and
incurable defect. Chuse you then in what manner this city shall be
governed. Shall it be by one man? Shall it be by a select number of
the wisest among us? or shall the legislative power be in the
people? As for me, I shall submit to whatever form of
administration you shall please to establish. As I think myself not
unworthy to command, so neither am I unwilling to obey. Your having
chosen me to be the leader of this colony, and your calling the
city after my name, are honours sufficient to content me; honours
of which, I or dead, I can never be deprived.</p>

Quinctius, <i>a Senator, of great reputation, well beloved, and now
in his fourth consulate, got the better of this opposition, by the

<p>Though I am not conscious, O Romans, of any crime by me
committed, it is yet with the utmost shame and confusion that I
appear in your assembly. You have seen it&mdash;posterity will know
it. In the fourth consulship of Titus Quinctius, the &AElig;qui and
Volsci, (scarce a match for the Hernici alone) came in arms to the
very gates of Rome, and went away unchastised! The course of our
manners, indeed, and the state of our affairs, have long been such,
that I had no reason to presage much good: But could I have
imagined that so great an ignominy would have befallen me this
year, I would by death; or banishment (if all other means had
failed) have avoided the station I am now in. What! might Rome then
have been taken, if those men who were at our gates had not wanted
courage for the attempt!&mdash;Rome taken while I was
consul&mdash;Of honours I had sufficient,&mdash;of life
enough&mdash;more than enough.&mdash;I should have died in my third
consulate. But who are they that our dastardly enemies thus
despise? The consuls, or you Romans? If we are in the fault, depose
us, or punish us yet more severely. If <i>you</i> are to blame, may
neither God nor man punish your faults! only may you repent. No,
Romans, the confidence of our enemies is not owing to their
courage, or to the belief of your cowardice. They have been too
often vanquished, not to know both themselves and you. Discord,
discord is the ruin of this city. The eternal disputes between the
senate and the people, are the sole cause of our misfortunes. While
we set no bounds to our dominion, nor you to your liberty: While
you patiently endure Patrician magistrates, and we Plebeian, our
enemies take heart, grow elated and presumptuous. In the name of
the immortal gods, what is it, Romans, you would have? You desired
tribunes; for the sake of peace we granted them. You were eager to
have decemvirs; we consented to their creation. You grew weary of
these decemvirs; we obliged them to abdicate. Your hatred pursued
them when reduced to private men; and we suffered you to put to
death, or banish, Patricians of the first rank in the republic. You
insisted upon the restoration of the tribuneship; we yielded; we
quietly saw consuls of your faction elected. You have the
protection of your tribunes, and the privilege of appeal: the
Patricians are subjected to the decrees of the commons. Under
pretence of equal and impartial laws, you have invaded our rights,
and we have suffered it, and we still suffer it. When shall we see
an end of discord? When shall we have one interest and one common
country? Victorious and triumphant, you shew less temper than we
under defeat. When you are to contend with <i>us</i>, you seize the
Aventine hill, you can possess yourselves of the Mons Sacer.</p>
<p>The enemy is at our gates, the &AElig;squiline is near being
taken, and nobody stirs to hinder it. But against <i>us</i> you are
valiant, against <i>us</i> you can arm with diligence. Come on,
then, besiege the senate house, make a camp of the forum, fill the
jails with our nobles, and when you have achieved these glorious
exploits, <i>then</i> at last sally out at the &AElig;squiline
gate, with the same fierce spirits against the enemy. Does your
resolution fail you for this? Go, then, and behold from your walls,
your lands ravaged, your houses plundered and in flames, the whole
country laid waste with fire and sword. Have you any thing here to
repair these damages? Will the tribunes make up your losses to you?
They'll give you as many words as you please: Bring impeachments in
abundance against the prime men of the state: Heap laws upon laws;
assemblies you shall have without end. But will any of you return
the richer from these assemblies? Extinguish, O Romans, those fatal
divisions; generously break this cursed enchantment, which keeps
you buried in a scandalous inaction. Open your eyes, and consider
the management of these ambitious men, who, to make themselves
powerful in their party, study nothing but how they may foment
divisions in the commonwealth.</p>
<p>If you can but summon up your former courage; if you will now
march out of Rome with your consuls, there is no punishment you can
inflict, which I will not submit to, if I do not in a few days
drive these pillagers out of our territory. This terror of war
(with which you seem so grievously struck) shall quickly be removed
from Rome to their own cities.</p>

<h2>CAIUS MARIUS <i>to the</i> ROMANS.</h2>
<p>It is but too common, my countrymen, to observe a material
difference between the behaviour of those who stand candidates, for
places of power and trust, before and after their obtaining them.
They solicit them in one manner, and execute them in another. They
set out with a great appearance of activity, humility, and
moderation; and they quickly fall into sloth, pride, and
avarice.&mdash;It is undoubtedly, no easy matter to discharge, to
the general satisfaction, the duty of a supreme commander in
troublesome times. I am, I hope, duly sensible of the importance of
the office I propose to take upon me, for the service of my
country. To carry on, with effect, an expensive war, and yet be
frugal of the public money; to oblige those to serve, whom it may
be delicate to offend; to conduct, at the same time, a complicated
variety of operations; to concert measures at home, answerable to
the state of things abroad; and to gain every valuable end, in
spite of opposition from the envious, the factious, and the
disaffected; to do all this, my countrymen, is more difficult than
is generally thought.</p>
<p>But, besides the disadvantages which are common to me, with all
others in eminent stations, my case is, in this respect, peculiarly
hard; that whereas a commander of Patrician rank, if he is guilty
of a neglect, or breach of duty, has his great connection, the
antiquity of his family, the important services of his ancestors,
and the multitudes he has, by power, engaged in his interest, to
screen him from condign punishment; my whole safety depends upon
myself; which renders it the more indispensibly necessary for me,
to take care that my conduct be clear and unexceptionable. Besides,
I am well aware, my country men, that the eye of the public is upon
me; and that, though the impartial, who prefer the real advantage
of the commonwealth to all other considerations, favour my
pretensions, the Patricians want nothing so much as an occasion
against me. It is, therefore, my fixed resolution, to use my best
endeavours, that you may not be disappointed in me, and that their
indirect designs against me may be defeated.</p>
<p>I have, from my youth, been familiar with toils, and with
dangers. I was faithful to your interests, my countrymen, when I
served you for no reward, but that of honour. It is not my design
to betray you, now that you have conferred upon me a place of
profit. You have committed to my conduct, the war against Jugurtha.
The Patricians are offended at this. But, where would be the wisdom
of giving such a command to one of their honourable body? a person
of illustrious birth, of ancient family, of innumerable statues,
but&mdash;of no experience! What service would his long line of
dead ancestors, or his multitude of motionless statues, do his
country in the day of battle? What could such a general do, but, in
his trepidation and inexperience, have recourse to some inferior
commander, for direction in difficulties to which he was not
himself equal? Thus, your Patrician general would, in fact have a
general over him; so that the acting commander would still be a
Plebeian. So true is this, my countrymen, that I have myself known
those, who have been chosen consuls, begin then to read the history
of their own country, of which, till that time, they were totally
ignorant: that is, they first obtained the employment, and then
bethought themselves of the qualifications necessary for the proper
discharge of it.</p>
<p>I submit to your judgment, Romans, on which side the advantage
lies, when a comparison is made between Patrician haughtiness and
Plebeian experience. The very actions, which they have only read, I
have partly seen, and partly myself achieved. What they know by
reading, I know by action. They are pleased to slight my mean
birth. I despise their mean characters. Want of birth and fortune
is the objection against me: want of personal merit against them.
But are not all men of the same species? What can make a difference
between one man and another but the endowments of the mind? For my
part, I shall always look upon the bravest man as the noblest man.
Suppose it were enquired of the fathers of such Patricians as
Albinus and Bessia, whether, if they had their choice, they would
desire sons of their character, or of mine: what would they answer,
but that they should wish the worthiest to be their sons. If the
Patricians have reason to despise me, let them likewise despise
their ancestors, whose nobility was the fruit of their virtue. Do
they envy the honours bestowed upon me? let them envy, likewise, my
labours, my abstinence, and the dangers I have undergone for my
country, by which I have acquired them. But those worthless men
lend such a life of inactivity, as if they despised any honours you
can bestow; whilst they aspire to honours, as if they had deserved
them by the most industrious virtue. They lay claim to the rewards
of activity, for their having enjoyed the pleasures of luxury. Yet
none can be more lavish than they are in praise of their ancestors:
and they imagine they honour themselves by celebrating their
forefathers. Whereas, they do the very contrary: for, as much as
their ancestors were distinguished for their virtues, so much are
they disgraced by their vices.</p>
<p>Observe now, my countrymen, the injustice of the Patricians.
They arrogate to themselves honours, on account of the exploits
done by their forefathers; whilst they will not allow me the due
praise, for performing the very same sort of actions in my own
person. He has no statues, they cry, of his family. He can trace no
venerable line of ancestors. What then! Is it matter of more praise
to disgrace one's illustrious ancestors, than to become illustrious
by one's own good behaviour? What if I can shew no statues of my
family: I can shew the standards, the armour, and the trappings,
which I have taken myself from the vanquished: I can shew the scars
of those wounds which I have received by facing the enemies of my
country. These are my statues; these are the honours I boast of.
Not left me by inheritance as theirs; but earned by toil, by
abstinence, by valour; amidst clouds of dust, and seas of blood:
scenes of action, where those effeminate Patricians, who endeavour,
by indirect means, to depreciate me in your esteem, have never
dared to shew their faces.</p>

"DEMOSTHENES_to_the_ATHENIANS"></a>
<h2>DEMOSTHENES <i>to the</i> ATHENIANS.</h2>
<p>When I compare, Athenians, the speeches of some amongst us, with
their actions, I am at a loss to reconcile what I see, with what I
hear. Their protestations are full of zeal against the public
enemy; but their measures are so inconsistent that all their
professions become suspected. By confounding you with a variety of
projects, they perplex your resolutions, and lead you from
executing what is in your power, by engaging you in schemes not
reducible to practice.</p>
<p>'Tis true, there was a time, when we were powerful enough, not
only to defend our own borders, and protect our allies, but even to
invade Philip in his own dominions. Yes, Athenians, there was such
a juncture; I remember it well. But, by neglect of proper
opportunities, we are no longer in a situation to be invaders: it
will be well for us, if we can procure for our own defence, and our
allies. Never did any conjuncture require so much prudence as this.
However, I should not despair of seasonable remedies, had I the art
to prevail with you to be unanimous in right measures. The
opportunities, which have so often escaped us have not been lost;
through ignorance, or want of judgment; but through negligence or
treachery.&mdash;If I assume, at this time, more than ordinary
liberty of speech, I conjure you to suffer, patiently, those
truths, which have no other end, but your own good. You have too
many reasons to be sensible how much you have suffered, by
hearkening to sycophants. I shall, therefore, be plain, in laying
before you the grounds of past miscarriages, in order to correct
you in your future conducts.</p>
<p>You may remember, it is not above three or four years since we
had the news of Philip's laying siege to the fortress of Juno, in
Thrace. It was, as I think, in October we received this
intelligence. We voted an immediate supply of threescore talents;
forty men of war were ordered to sea: and so zealous we were, that
preferring the necessities of state to our very laws, our citizens
above the age of five and forty years, were commanded to serve.
What followed?&mdash;A whole year was spent idly, without any thing
done; and it was but the third month of the following year, a
little after the celebration of the feast of Ceres, that Charedemus
set sail, furnished with no more than five talents, and ten
galleys, not half manned.</p>
<p>A rumour was spread that Philip was sick. That rumour was
followed by another, that Philip was dead. And, then, as if all
danger died with him, you dropped your preparations: whereas then,
then was your time to push, and be active; then was your time to
secure yourselves, and confound him at once. Had your resolutions,
taken with so much heat, been as warmly seconded by action, you had
then been as terrible to Philip, as Philip, recovered, is now to
you. "To what purpose, at this time, these reflections! What is
done cannot be undone." But, by your leave, Athenians; though past
moments are not to be recalled, past errors may be repeated. Have
we not now, a fresh provocation to war? Let the memory of
oversights, by which you have suffered so much, instruct you to be
more vigilant in the present danger. If the Olynthians are not
instantly succoured, and with your utmost efforts, you become
assistants to Philip, and serve him more effectually than he can
help himself.</p>
<p>It is not, surely, necessary to warn you, that votes alone can
be of no consequence. Had your resolutions, of themselves, the
virtue to compass what you intend, we should not see them multiply
every day, as they do, and upon every occasion, with so little
effect: nor would Philip be in a condition to brave and affront us
in this manner.&mdash;Proceed, then, Athenians, to support your
deliberations with vigour. You have heads capable of advising what
is best; you have judgment and experience, to discern what is
right; and you have power and opportunity to execute what you
determine. What time so proper for action! What occasion so happy?
And when can you hope for such another, if this be neglected? Has
not Philip, contrary to all treaties, insulted you in Thrace? Does
he not, at this instant, straiten and invade your confederates,
whom you have solemnly sworn to protect? Is he not an implacable
enemy? a faithless ally? the usurper of provinces, to which he has
no title nor pretence? a stranger, a barbarian, a tyrant? and
indeed, what is he not?</p>
<p>Observe, I beseech you, men of Athens, how different your
conduct appears from the practices of your ancestors. They were
friends to truth and plain dealing, and detested flattery and
servile compliance. By unanimous consent they continued arbiters of
all Greece for the space of forty-five years, without interruption;
a public fund, of no less than ten thousand talents, were ready for
any emergency: they exercised over the kings of Macedon that
authority which is due to Barbarians; obtained, both by sea and
land, in their own persons frequent and signal victories and by
their noble exploits, transmitted to posterity an immortal memory
of their virtue, superior to the reach of malice and detraction. It
is to them we owe that great number of public edifices, by which
the city of Athens exceeds all the rest of the world, in beauty and
magnificence. It is to them we owe so many stately temples, so
richly embellished; but, above all, adorned with the spoils of
vanquished enemies&mdash;But, visit their own private habitations;
visit the houses of Aristides, Militiades, or any other of those
patriots of antiquity; you will find nothing, not the least mark of
ornament, to distinguish them from their neighbours. They took part
in the government, not to enrich themselves, but the public; they
had no schemes or ambition, but for the public nor knew any
interest, but the public. It was by a close and steady application
to the general good of their country; by an exemplary piety toward
the immortal gods; by a strict faith, and religious honesty,
betwixt man and man; and a moderation, always uniform, and of
apiece; they established that reputation, which remains to this
day, and will last to utmost posterity.</p>
<p>Such, O men of Athens! were your ancestors; so glorious in the
eye of the world; so bountiful and munificent to their country; so
sparing, so modest, so self-denying to themselves. What resemblance
can we find in the present generation, of these great men? At a
time, when your ancient competitors have left you a clear stage;
when the Lacedemonians are disabled; the Thebans employed in
troubles of their own; when no other state whatever is in a
condition to rival or molest you: in short, when you are at full
liberty; when you have the opportunity and the power to become once
more the sole arbiters of Greece; you permit, patiently, whole
provinces to be arrested from you; you lavish the public money to
scandalous and obscure uses; you suffer your allies to perish in
time of peace, whom you preserved in time of war; and, to sum up
all, you yourselves, by your mercenary court, and servile
resignation to the will and pleasure of designing, insidious
leaders, abet, encourage, and strengthen the most dangerous and
formidable of your enemies. Yes, Athenians, I repeat it, you
yourselves are the contrivers of your own ruin. Lives there a man
who has confidence enough to deny it? let him arise, and assign, if
he can, any other cause of the success and prosperity of Philip.
"But," you reply, "what Athens may have lost in reputation abroad,
she has gained in splendor at home. Was there ever a greater
appearance of prosperity! a greater face of plenty? Is not the city
enlarged? Are not the streets better paved? houses repaired and
beautified?"&mdash;Away with such trifles! Shall I be paid with
counters? An old square new vamped up! a fountain! an aqueduct! Are
these acquisitions to brag of? Cast your eye upon the magistrate,
under whose ministry you boast these precious improvements. Behold
the despicable creature, raised, all at once, from dirt to
opulence; from the lowest obscurity to the highest honours. Have
not some of these upstarts built private houses and seats, vying
with the most sumptuous of our public palaces? And how have their
fortunes and their power increased, but as the commonwealth has
been ruined and impoverished!</p>
<p>To what are we to impute these disorders? and to what cause
assign the decay of a state, so powerful and flourishing in past
time?&mdash;The reason is plain. The servant is now become the
master. The magistrate was then subservient to the people:
punishments and rewards were properties of the people: all honours,
dignities, and preferments were disposed by the voice and favour of
the people. But the magistrate, now, has usurped the right of the
people, and exercises an arbitrary authority over his ancient and
natural lord. You miserable people! the mean while, without money,
without friends; from being the ruler, are become the servant; from
being the master, the dependant: happy that these governors, into
whose hands you have thus resigned your own power, are so good, and
so gracious, as to continue your poor allowance to see plays.</p>
<p>Believe me, Athenians, if recovering from this lethargy, you
would assume the ancient freedom and spirit of your fathers; if you
would be your own soldiers, and your own commanders, confiding no
longer your affairs in foreign or mercenary hands; if you would
charge yourselves with your own defence, employing abroad, for the
public, what you waste in unprofitable pleasures at home, the world
might, once more, behold you making a figure worthy of Athenians.
"You would have us then (you say) do service in our armies, in our
own persons; and for so doing, you would have the pensions we
receive in time of peace, accepted as pay in time of war. Is it
thus we are to understand you?"&mdash;Yes, Athenians, 'tis my plain
meaning. I would make it a standing rule, that no person, great or
little, should be the better for the public money, who should
grudge to employ it for the public service. Are we in peace? the
public is charged with your subsistence. Are we in war, or under a
necessity, as at this time, to enter into a war? let your gratitude
oblige you to accept, as pay, in defence of your benefactors, what
you receive, in peace, as mere bounty.&mdash;Thus, without any
innovation, without altering or abolishing any thing, but
pernicious novelties, introduced for the encouragement of sloth and
idleness; by converting only for the future the same funds for the
use of the serviceable, which are spent, at present, upon the
unprofitable; you may be well served in your armies; your troops
regularly paid; justice duly administered; the public revenues
reformed and increased; and every member of the commonwealth
rendered useful to his country, according to his age and ability,
without any further burden to the state.</p>
<p>This, O men of Athens! is what my duty prompted me to represent
to you upon this occasion.&mdash;May the gods inspire you to
determine upon such measures as may be most expedient for the
particular and general good of our country!</p>

<h2><i>On the duties of School-Boys, from the pious and
judicious</i></h2>
<div style='text-align: right; margin-right: 10%;'>ROLLIN.</div>
<p>Quintillian says, that he has included almost all the duty of
scholars in this one piece of advice which he gives them, to love
those who teach them, as they love the science which they learn of
them; and to look upon them as fathers, from whom they derive not
the life of the body, but that instruction which is in a manner the
life of the soul. Indeed this sentiment of affection, and respect
suffices to make them apt to learn during the time of their
studies, and full of gratitude all the rest of their lives. It
seems to me to include a great part of what is to be expected from
them.</p>
<p>Docility, which consists in submitting to directions, in readily
receiving the instructions of their masters; and reducing them to
practice, is properly the virtue of scholars, as that of masters is
to teach well. The one can do nothing without the other; and as it
is not sufficient for a labourer to sow the seed, unless the earth,
after having opened its bosom to receive it, in a manner hatches,
warms, and moistens it; so likewise the whole fruit of instruction
depends upon a good correspondence between the masters and the
scholars.</p>
<p>Gratitude for those who have laboured in our education, is the
character of an honest man, and the mark of a good heart. Who is
there among us, says Cicero, that has been instructed with any
care, that is not highly delighted with the sight, or even the bare
remembrance of his preceptors, masters, and the place where he was
taught and brought up? Seneca exhorts young men to preserve always
a great respect for their masters, to whose care they are indebted
for the amendment of their faults, and for having imbibed
sentiments of honour and probity. Their exactness and severity
displease sometimes, at an age when we are not in a condition to
judge of the obligations we owe to them; but when years have
ripened our understanding and judgment, we then discern that what
made us dislike them, I mean admonitions, reprimands, and a severe
exactness in restraining the passions of an imprudent and
inconsiderate age, is expressly the very thing which should make us
esteem and love them. Thus we see that Marcus Aurelius, one of the
wisest and most illustrious emperors that Rome ever had, thanked
the gods for two things especially&mdash;for his having had
excellent tutors himself, and that he had found the like for his
children.</p>
<p>Quintillian, after having noted the different characters of the
mind in children, draws, in a few words, the image of what he
judged to be a perfect scholar; and certainly it is a very amiable
one: "For my part," says he, "I like a child who is encouraged by
commendation, is animated by a sense of glory, and weeps when he is
outdone. A noble emulation will always keep him in exercise, a
reprimand will touch him to the quick, and honour will serve
instead of a spur. We need not fear that such a scholar will ever
give himself up to sullenness." <i>Mihi ille detur puer, quem laus
excitet, quem gloria juvet, qui virtus fleut. Hic erit alendus
ambitu: hunc mordebit objurgetio; hunc honor excitabit; in hoc
desidium nunquam verebor.</i></p>
<p>How great a value soever Quintillian sets upon the talents of
the mind, he esteems those of the heart far beyond them, and looks
upon the others as of no value without them. In the same chapter
from whence I took the preceding words, he declares, he should
never have a good opinion of a child, who placed his study in
occasioning laughter, by mimicking the behaviour, mien, and faults
of others; and he presently gives an admirable reason for it: "A
child," says he, "cannot be truly ingenuous, in my opinion, unless
he be good and virtuous; otherwise, I should rather choose to have
him dull and heavy, than of a bad disposition." <i>Non dubit spem
bonoe indolis, qui hoc initandi studio petit, ut rideatur. Nam
probus quoque imprimus erit ille vere ingeniosus: alioquinon pejus
duxerim tardi esse ingenii, quam mali.</i></p>
<p>He displays to us all these talents in the eldest of his two
children, whose character he draws, and whose death he laments in
so eloquent and pathetic a strain, in the beautiful preface to his
sixth book. I shall beg leave to insert here a small extract of it,
which will not be useless to the boys, as they will find it a model
which suits well with their age and condition.</p>
<p>Alter having mentioned his younger son, who died at five years
old, and described the graces and beauties of his countenance, the
prettiness of his expression, the vivacity of his understanding,
which began to shine through the veil of childhood: "I had still
left me," says he, "my son Quintillian, in whom I placed all my
pleasure and all my hopes, and comfort enough I might have found in
him; for, having now entered into his tenth year, he did not
produce only blossoms like his younger brother, but fruits already
formed, and beyond the power of disappointment.&mdash;I have much
experience; but I never saw in any child, I do not say only so many
excellent dispositions for the sciences, nor so much taste, as his
masters know, but so much probity, sweetness, good nature,
gentleness, and inclination to please and oblige, as I discerned in
him."</p>
<p>"Besides this, he had all the advantages of nature, a charming
voice, a pleasing countenance, and a surprising facility in
pronouncing well the two languages, as if he had been equally born
for both of them.</p>
<p>"But all this was no more than hopes. I set a greater value upon
his admirable virtues, his equality of temper, his resolution, the
courage with which he bore up against fear and pain; for, how were
his physicians astonished at his patience under a distemper of
eight months continuance, when at the point of death he comforted
me himself, and bade me not to weep for him! and delirious as he
sometimes was at his last moments, his tongue ran on nothing else
but learning and the sciences: O vain and deceitful hopes!"
&amp;c.</p>
<p>Are there many boys amongst us, of whom we can truly say so much
to their advantage, as Quintillian says here of his son? What a
shame would it be for them, if born and brought up in a Christian
country, they had not even the virtues of Pagan children! I make no
scruple to repeat them here again&mdash;docility, obedience,
respect for their masters, or rather a degree of affection, and the
source of an eternal gratitude; zeal for study, and a wonderful
thirst after the sciences, joined to an abhorrence of vice and
irregularity; an admirable fund of probity, goodness, gentleness,
civility, and liberality; as also patience, courage, and greatness
of soul in the course of a long sickness.&mdash;What then was
wanting to all these virtues?&mdash;That which alone could render
them truly worthy the name, and must be in a manner the soul of
them, and constitute their whole value, the precious gift of faith
and piety; the saving knowledge of a Mediator; a sincere desire of
pleasing God, and referring all our actions to him.</p>

<h3>PHILOSOPHIC SOLITUDE, &amp;c.</h3>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'><span>Let ardent heroes seek renown in
arms,<br></span> <span>Pant after fame, and rush to war's
alarms;<br></span> <span>To shining palaces let fools
resort,<br></span> <span>And dunces cringe to be esteem'd at
court:<br></span> <span>Mine be the pleasure of a <i>rural</i>
life,<br></span> <span>From noise remote, and ignorant of
strife;<br></span> <span>Far from the painted belle, and
white-glov'd beau,<br></span> <span>The lawless masquerade and
midnight show;<br></span> <span>From ladies, lap-dogs, courtiers,
garters, stars,<br></span> <span>Fops, fiddlers, tyrants, emperors,
and czars.<br></span></div>
<div class='stanza'><span>Full in the centre of some shady
grove,<br></span> <span>By nature form'd for solitude and
love;<br></span> <span>On banks array'd with ever-blooming
flow'rs,<br></span> <span>Near beaut'ous landscapes, or by roseate
bow'rs,<br></span> <span>My neat, but simple mansion I would
raise,<br></span> <span>Unlike the sumptuous domes of modern
days;<br></span> <span>Devoid of pomp, with rural plainness
form'd,<br></span> <span>With savage game, and glossy shells
adorn'd.<br></span></div>
<div class='stanza'><span>No costly furniture should grace my
hall;<br></span> <span>But curling vines ascend against the
wall,<br></span> <span>Whose pliant branches shou'd luxuriant
twine,<br></span> <span>While purple clusters swell'd with future
wine<br></span> <span>To slake my thirst a liquid lapse
distill,<br></span> <span>From craggy rocks, and spread a limpid
rill.<br></span> <span>Along my mansion spiry firs should
grow,<br></span> <span>And gloomy yews extend the shady
row;<br></span></div>
<div class='stanza'><span>The cedars flourish, and the poplars
rise<br></span> <span>Sublimely tall, and shoot into the
skies:<br></span> <span>Among the leaves refreshing zephyrs
play,<br></span> <span>And crouding trees exclude the noon-tide
ray;<br></span> <span>Whereon the birds their downy nests should
form,<br></span> <span>Securely shelter'd from the batt'ring
storm;<br></span> <span>And to melodious notes their choir
apply,<br></span> <span>Soon as Aurora blush'd along the
sky:<br></span> <span>While all around the enchanting music
rings,<br></span> <span>And every vocal grove reponsive
sings.<br></span></div>
<div class='stanza'><span>Me to sequester'd scenes, ye muses
guide,<br></span> <span>Where nature wanton's in her virgin
pride,<br></span> <span>To mossy banks, edg'd round with op'ning
flow'rs,<br></span> <span>Elysian fields and amaranthian
bow'rs;<br></span> <span>T' ambrosial founts, and sleep-inspiring
rills,<br></span> <span>To herbag'd vales, gay lawns, and funny
hills.<br></span></div>
<div class='stanza'><span>Welcome ye shades! all hail, ye vernal
blooms<br></span> <span>Ye bow'ry thickets, and prophetic
glooms!<br></span> <span>Ye forests hail! ye solitary
woods!<br></span> <span>Love-whispering groves and silver-streaming
floods!<br></span> <span>Ye meads, that aromatic sweets
exhale!<br></span> <span>Ye birds, and all ye sylvan beauties
hail!<br></span> <span>Oh how I long with you to spend my
days,<br></span> <span>Invoke the muse, and try the rural
lays!<br></span></div>
<div class='stanza'><span>No trumpets there with martial clangor
found,<br></span> <span>No prostrate heroes strew the crimson'd
ground;<br></span> <span>No groves of lances glitter in the
air,<br></span> <span>Nor thund'ring drums provoke the sanguine
war;<br></span> <span>but white-rob'd peace, and universal
love<br></span> <span>Smile in the field, and brighten, ev'ry
grove,<br></span> <span>There all the beauties of the circling
year,<br></span> <span>In native ornamental pride
appear;<br></span> <span>Gay rosy-bosom'd SPRING, and <i>April</i>
show'rs;<br></span> <span>Wake from the womb of earth the rising
flow'rs:<br></span> <span>In deeper verdure SUMMER clothes the
plain,<br></span> <span>And AUTUMN bends beneath the golden
grain;<br></span> <span>The trees weep amber, and the whispering
gales<br></span> <span>Breeze o'er the lawn, or murmur through the
vales:<br></span> <span>The flow'ry tribes in gay confusion
bloom,<br></span> <span>Profuse of sweets, and fragrant with
perfume;<br></span> <span>On blossoms blossoms, fruits on fruits
arise.<br></span> <span>And varied prospects glad the wand'ring
eyes.<br></span> <span>In these fair seats I'd pass the joyous
day,<br></span> <span>Where meadows flourish and where fields look
gay;<br></span> <span>From bliss to bliss with endless pleasure
rove,<br></span> <span>Seek crystal streams, or haunt the vernal
grove,<br></span> <span>Woods, fountains, lakes, the fertile
fields, or shades<br></span> <span>Aerial mountains, or subjacent
glades.<br></span></div>
<div class='stanza'><span>There from the polish'd fetters of the

state;<br></span> <span>Prime ministers, and sycophantic
knaves;<br></span> <span>Illustrious villains, and illustrious
slaves;<br></span> <span>From all the vain formality of
fools,<br></span> <span>An odious task of arbitrary
rules;<br></span> <span>The ruffling cares which the vex'd soul
annoy,<br></span> <span>The wealth the rich possess, but not
enjoy,<br></span> <span>The visionary bliss the world can
lend,<br></span> <span>The insidious foe, and false designing
friend,<br></span> <span>The seven-fold fury of <i>Xantippe</i>'s
soul,<br></span> <span>And <i>S&mdash;&mdash;</i>'s rage that burns
without controul;<br></span> <span>I'd live retir'd, contented, and
serene,<br></span> <span>Forgot, unknown, unenvied and
unseen.<br></span></div>
<div class='stanza'><span>Yet not a real hermitage I'd
chuse,<br></span> <span>Nor wish to live from all the world
recluse;<br></span> <span>But with a friend sometimes unbend the

bowl.<br></span> <span>With cheerful <i>W&mdash;&mdash;</i>, serene

just;<br></span> <span>Of soul diffusive, vast and
unconfin'd,<br></span> <span>Breathing benevolence to all
mankind;<br></span> <span>Cautious to censure, ready to
commend,<br></span> <span>A firm, unshaken, uncorrupted

swain,<br></span> <span>Whose constant cares were to increase his
store,<br></span> <span>And keep his only son, myself, at
home.<br></span> <span>For I had heard of battles, and I
long'd<br></span> <span>To follow to the field some warlike

her light,<br></span> <span>A band of fierce barbarians, from the
hills<br></span> <span>Rush'd, like a torrent, down upon the
vale,<br></span> <span>Sweeping our flocks and herds. The shepherds
fled<br></span> <span>For safety and for succour. I
alone,<br></span> <span>With bended bow, and quiver full of
arrows,<br></span> <span>Hover'd about the enemy, and
mark'd<br></span> <span>The road he took; then hasted to my

Eve<br></span> <span>With tresses discomposed, and glowing
cheek.<br></span> <span>As through unquiet rest. He, on his
side<br></span> <span>Leaning half rais'd, with looks of cordial
love,<br></span> <span>Hung over her enamour'd; and
beheld<br></span> <span>Beauty, which, whether waking or
asleep,<br></span> <span>Shot forth peculiar graces. Then, with
voice<br></span> <span>Mild as when Zephyrus on Flora
breathes,<br></span> <span>Her hand soft touching, whispered thus;
"Awake,<br></span> <span>"My fairest, my espous'd, my latest

death<br></span> <span>(That undiscover'd country, from whose

<p>I will tell you, Sir, by the way of private, and under seal. I
am a gentleman; and live here, obscure, and to myself; but, were I
known to his Majesty, and the Lords, observe me, I would undertake,
upon this poor head and life, for the public benefit or the state,
not only to spare the entire lives of his subjects in general, but
to save the one half, nay three parts of his yearly charge, in
holding war, and against what enemy soever. And how would I do it,
think you? Why thus, Sir. I would select nineteen more to myself,
throughout the land; gentlemen they should be; of good spirit,
strong and able constitution. I would chuse them by an instinct
that I have. And I would teach these nineteen, the special rules;
as your Punto, your Reverso, your Stoccaio, your Imbroccato, your
Passada, your Montonto; till they could all play very near, or
altogether, as well as myself. This done, say the enemy were forty
thousand strong. We twenty, would come into the field the tenth of
March or thereabouts; and we would challenge twenty of the enemy;
they could not, in their honour refuse us: Well, we would kill
them; challenge twenty more, kill them: twenty more, kill them:
twenty more, kill them too. And thus, would we kill, every man, his
twenty a day; that's twenty score; twenty score; that's two
hundred; two hundred a day; five days, a thousand: forty
thousand&mdash;forty times five&mdash;five times forty&mdash;two
hundred days kill them all up by computation. And this I will
venture my poor gentleman-like carcase to perform (provided there
by no treason practised upon) by fair and discreet manhood; that
is, civilly by the sword.</p>

<p>A good sherris-sack hath a two-fold operation in it. It ascends
me into the brain. Dries me there, all-the foolish, dull, and crudy
vapours which environ it: makes it apprehensive, quick, inventive;
full of nimble, fiery, and delectable shapes, which, delivered over
to the voice, the tongue, which is the birth, becomes excellent
wit&mdash;The second property of your excellent sherris, is, the
warming of the blood; which, before, cold and settled, left the
liver white and pale: which is the badge of pusillanimity and
cowardice. But the sherris warms it, and makes its course from the
inwards to the parts extreme. It illuminateth the face, which, as a
beacon, gives warning to all the rest of this little kingdom, man,
to arm; and then, the vital commoners, and inland petty spirits,
muster me all to their captain, the heart; who, great, and puffed
up with this retinue, doth any deed of courage&mdash;and this value
comes of sherris. So that skill in the weapon, is nothing without
sack; for that sets it a-work; and learning, a mere hoard of gold
kept by a devil, till sack commences it, and sets it in act and
use. Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant; for the cold
blood he did naturally inherit of his father, he hath, like lean,
steril, and bare land, manured, husbanded, and tilled, with
drinking good, and good store of fertile sherris&mdash;If I had a

<h2>Elements of Gesture.</h2>

<h2>SECTION I.</h2>
<h2><i>On the Speaking of Speeches at Schools</i>.</h2>
<p>Elocution has, for some years past, been an object of attention
in the most respectable schools in this country. A laudable
ambition of instructing youth in the pronunciation and delivery of
their native language, has made English speeches a very conspicuous
part of those exhibitions of oratory which do them so much
credit.</p>
<p>This attention to English pronunciation has induced several
ingenious men to compile Exercises in Elocution for the use of
schools, which have answered very useful purposes; but none, so far
as I have seen, have attempted to give us a regular system of
gesture suited to the wants and capacities of school-boys. Mr.
Burgh, in his Art of Speaking, has given us a system of the
passions, and has shewn us how they appear in the countenance, and
operate on the body; but this system, however useful to people of
riper years, is too delicate and complicated to be taught in
schools. Indeed, the exact adaptation of the action to the word,
and the word to the action, as Shakespear calls it, is the most
difficult part of delivery, and therefore can never be taught
perfectly to children; to say nothing of distracting their
attention with two difficult things at the same time. But that boys
should stand motionless, while they are pronouncing the most
impassioned language, is extremely absurd and unnatural; and that
they should sprawl into an aukward, ungain, and desultory action,
is still more offensive and disgusting. What then remains, but that
such a general style of action be adopted, as shall be easily
conceived and easily executed, which, though not expressive of any
particular passion, shall not be inconsistent with the expression
of any passion; which shall always keep the body in a graceful
position, and shall so vary its motions; at proper intervals, as to
seem the subject operating on the speaker, and not the speaker on
the subject. This, it will be confessed, is a great desideratum;
and an attempt to do this, is the principal object of the present
publication.</p>
<p>The difficulty of describing action by words, will be allowed by
every one; and if we were never to give any instructions but such
as should completely answer our wishes, this difficulty would be a
good reason for not attempting to give any description of it. But
there are many degrees between conveying a precise idea of a thing,
and no idea at all. Besides, in this part of delivery, instruction
may be conveyed by the eye; and this organ is a much more rapid
vehicle of knowledge than the ear. This vehicle is addressed on the
present, occasion, and plates, representing the attitudes which are
described, are annexed to the several descriptions, which it is not
doubted will greatly facilitate the reader's conception.</p>
<p>The first plate represents the attitude in which a boy should
always place himself when he begins to speak. He should rest the
whole weight of his body on the right leg; the other, just touching
the ground, at the distance at which it would naturally fall, if
lifted up to shew that the body does not bear upon it. The knees
should be strait and braced, and the body, though perfectly strait,
not perpendicular, but inclining as far to the right as a firm
position on the right leg will permit. The right arm must then be
held out with the palm open, the fingers straight and close, the
thumb almost as distant from them as it will go, and the flat of
the hand neither horizontal nor vertical, but exactly between both.
The position of the arm perhaps will be best described by supposing
an oblong hollow square, formed by the measure of four arms, as in
plate the first, where the arm in its true position forms the
diagonal of such an imaginary figure. So that, if lines were drawn
at right angles from the shoulder, extending downwards, forwards,
and sideways, the arm will form a&amp; angle of forty-five degrees
every way.</p>
<h3>PLATE I.</h3>
<center><img src='images/plate1.gif' width='656' height='770' alt=
'PLATE I.' title=''></center>
<p>When the pupil has pronounced one sentence in the position thus
described, the hand, as if lifeless, must drop down to the side,
the very moment the last accepted word is pronounced; and the body,
without altering the place of the feet, poise itself on the left
leg, while the left hand rises itself into exactly the same
position as the right was before, and continues in this position
till tine end of the next sentence, when it drops down on the side,
as if dead; and the body poizing itself on the right leg as before,
continues with the right arm extended, till the end of the
succeeding sentence, and so on from right to left, and from left to
right alternately, till the speech is ended.</p>
<h3>PLATE II.</h3>
<center><img src='images/plate2.gif' width='481' height='804' alt=
'PLATE II.' title=''></center>
<p>Great care must he taken that the pupil end one sentence
completely, before he begin another. He must let the arm drop to
the side, and continue for a moment in that posture in which he
concluded, before he poizes his body on the other leg, and raises
the other arm into the diagonal position before described; both
which should be done before he begins to pronounce the next
sentence. Care must also he taken in shifting the body from one leg
to the other, that the feet do not alter their distance. In
altering the position of the body, the feet will necessarily alter
their position a little; but this change must be made by turning
the toes in a somewhat different direction, without suffering them
to shift their ground. The heels, in this transition, change their
place, but not the toes. The toes may be considered as pivots, on
which the body turns from side to side.</p>
<p>If the pupil's knees are not well formed, or incline inwards, he
must be taught to keep his legs at as great a distance as possible,
and to incline his body so much to that side, on which the arm is
extended, as to oblige him to rest the opposite leg upon the toe;
and this will, in a great measure, hide the defect of his make. In
the same manner, if the arm be too long, or the elbow incline
inwards, it will be proper to make him turn the palm of his hand
downwards, so as to make it perfectly horizontal. This will
infallibly incline the elbow outwards, and prevent the worst
position the arm can possibly fall into, which is that of inclining
the elbow to the body. This position of the hand so necessarily
keeps the elbow out, that it would not be improper to make the
pupil sometimes practice it, though he may have no defect in his
make; as an occasional alteration of the former position to this,
may often be necessary both for the sake of justness and variety.
These two last positions of the legs and arms, are described in
plate second.</p>
<p>When the pupil has got the habit of holding his hand and arm
properly, he may be taught to move it. In this motion he must be
careful to keep the arm from the body. He must neither draw the
elbow backwards, nor suffer it to approach to the side, bur, while
the hand and lower joint of the arm are curving towards the
shoulder, the whole arm, with the elbow forming nearly an angle of
a square, should move upwards from the shoulder, in the same
position as when gracefully taking off the hat; that is, with the
elbow extended from the side, and the upper joint of the arm nearly
on a line with the shoulder, and forming an angle of a square with
the body&mdash;(see plate III.) This motion of the arm will
naturally bring the hand with the palm downwards, into an
horizontal position, and when it approaches to the head, the arm
should with a jerk be suddenly straitened into its first position,
at the very moment the emphatical word is pronounced. This
coincidence of the hand and voice, will greatly enforce the
pronunciation; and if they keep time, they will be in tune as it
were to each other, and to force and energy add harmony and
variety.</p>
<p>As this motion of the arm is somewhat complicated, and may be
found difficult to execute, it would be adviseable to let the pupil
at first speak without any motion of the arm at all. After some
time he will naturally fall into a small curvature of the elbow, to
beat time, as it were, to the emphatic word; and if, in doing this,
he is constantly urged to raise the elbow, and to keep it at a
distance from the body, the action of the arm will naturally grow
up into that we have just described. So the diagonal position of
the arm, though the most graceful and easy when the body is at
rest, may he too difficult for boys to fall into at first; and
therefore it may be necessary, in order to avoid the worse extreme,
for some time to make them extend the arm as far from the body as
they can, in a somewhat similar direction, but higher from the
ground, and inclining more to the back. Great care must be taken to
keep the hand open, and the thumb at some distance from the
fingers; and particular attention must be paid to keeping the hand
in the exact line with the lower part of the arm, so as not to bend
at the wrist, either when it is held out without motion, or when it
gives the emphatic stroke. And above all, the body must be kept in
a straight line with the leg on which it bears, and not suffered to
bend to the opposite side.</p>
<h3>PLATE III.</h3>
<center><img src='images/plate3.gif' width='485' height='767' alt=
'PLATE III.' title=''></center>
<p>At first it may not be improper for the teacher, after placing
the pupil in the position plate I. to stand at some distance
exactly opposite to him in the same position, the right and left
sides only reversed, and while the pupil is speaking, to show him
by example the action he is to make use of. In this case the
teacher's left hand will correspond for the pupil's right, by which
means he will see as in a looking-glass, how to regulate his
gesture, and will soon catch the method of doing it by himself.</p>
<p>It is expected the master will be a little discouraged at the
aukward figure his pupil makes in his first attempts to teach him.
But this is no more than what happens in dancing, fencing, or any
other exercise which depends on habit. By practice, the pupil will
soon begin to feel his position, and be easy in it. Those positions
which were at first distressing to him, he will fall into
naturally, and if they are such as are really graceful and becoming
(and such it is presumed are those which have been just described)
they will be adopted with more facility than any other that can be
taught him.</p>

<h2>SECTION II.</h2>
<h2><i>On the Acting of Plays at School</i>.</h2>
<p>Though the acting of plays at schools has been universally
supposed a very useful practice, it has of late years been much
laid aside. The advantages arising from it have not been judged
equal to the inconveniencies; and the speaking of single speeches,
or the acting of single scenes, has been generally substituted in
its stead. Indeed when we consider the leading principle and
prevailing sentiments of most plays, we shall not wonder that they
are not always thought to be the most suitable employment for youth
at school; nor, when we reflect on the long interruption to the
common school-exercises, which the preparation for a play must
necessarily occasion, shall we think it consistent with the general
improvement:&mdash;But, to wave every objection from prudence or
morality, it may be confidently affirmed, that the acting of a play
is not so conducive to improvement in elocution, as the speaking of
single speeches.</p>
<p>In the first place, the acting of plays is of all kinds of
delivery the most difficult; and therefore cannot be the most
suitable exercise for boys at school. In the next place, a dramatic
performance requires so much attention to the deportment of the
body, so varied an expression of the passions, and so strict an
adherence to character, that elocution is in danger of being
neglected: Besides, exact propriety of action, and a nice
discrimination of the passions, however essential on the stage, are
but of a secondary importance in a school. It is plain, open,
distinct, and forcible pronunciation which school-boys should aim
at; and not that quick transition from one passion to another, that
archness of look, and that <i>jeu de theatre</i>, as it is called,
so essential to a tolerable dramatic exhibition, and which actors
themselves can scarcely arrive at. In short, it is speaking rather
than acting which school-boys should be taught, while the
performance of plays is calculated to teach them acting rather than
speaking.</p>
<p>But there is a contrary extreme into which many teachers are apt
to run, and that is, to condemn every thing which is vehement and
forcible as <i>theatrical</i>. It is an old trick to depreciate
what we can not attain, and calling a spirited pronunciation
<i>theatrical</i>, is but an artful method of hiding an utter
inability of speaking with force and energy. But though school-boys
ought not to be taught those nice touches which form the greatest
difficulties in the profession of an actor, they should not be too
much restrained from an exertion of voice, so necessary to
strengthening the organs of sound, because they may sometimes be
too loud and vociferous. Perhaps nine out of ten, instead of too
much confidence, and too violent a manner of speaking, which these
teachers seem so much to dread, have as Dr. Johnson calls it, a
frigid equality, a stupid languor, and a torpid apathy. These must
be roused by something strong and excessive, or they will never
rise even to mediocrity; while the few who have a tendency to rant,
are very easily reclaimed; and ought to be treated in pronunciation
and action, as Quintillion advises to do in composition; that is,
we should rather allow of an exuberance, than, by too much
correctness, check the vigour and luxuriancy of nature.</p>
<h3>PLATE IV.</h3>
<center><img src='images/plate4.gif' width='537' height='360' alt=
'PLATE IV.' title=''></center>
<p>Though school-boys, therefore, ought not to be taught the
finesses of acting, they should as much as possible be accustomed
to speak such speeches as require a full, open, animated
pronunciation: for which purpose, they should be confined chiefly
to orations, odes, and such single speeches of plays, as are in the
declamatory and vehement style. But as there are many scenes of
plays, which are justly reckoned among the finest compositions of
the language, some of these may be adopted among the upper class of
boys, and those more particularly who have the best deportment: for
action in scenes will be found much more difficult than in single
speeches. And here it will be necessary to give some additional
instructions respecting action, as a speaker who delivers himself
singly to an auditory, and one who addresses another speaker in
view of an auditory, are under very different predicaments. The
first has only one object to address, the last has two:&mdash;For
if a speaker on the stage were to address the person he speaks to,
without any regard to the point of view in which he stands with
respect to the audience, he would be apt to turn his back on them,
and to place himself in such positions as would be highly
ungraceful and disgusting. When a scene, therefore, is represented,
it is necessary that the two personages who speak should form a
sort of picture, and place themselves in a position agreeable to
the laws of perspective. In order to do this, it will be necessary
that each of them should stand obliquely, and chiefly make use of
one hand: that is, supposing the stage or platform where they
stand, to be a quadrangle, each speaker should respectively face
that corner of it next to the audience, and use that hand and rest
upon that leg which is next to the person he speaks to, and which
is farthest from the audience. This disposition is absolutely
necessary to form any thing like a picturesque grouping of objects,
and without it, that is, if both speakers use the right hand, and
stand exactly fronting each other, the impropriety will be
palpable, and the spectacle disgusting.</p>
<p>It need scarcely be noted, that the speaker in a scene uses that
hand which is next the audience, he ought likewise to poize his
body upon the same leg: this is almost an invariable rule in
action: the hand should act on that side only on which the body
bears. Good actors and speakers may sometimes depart from this
rule, but such only will know when to do it with propriety.</p>
<p>Occasion may be taken in the course of the scene to change
sides. One speaker at the end of an impassioned speech, may cross
over to the place of the other, while the latter at the same moment
crosses over to the place of the former. This, however, must be
done with great care, and so as to keep the back from being turned
to the audience: But if this transition be performed adroitly, it
will have a very good effect in varying the position of the
speakers, and giving each an opportunity of using his right
hand&mdash;the most favourable to grace and expression. And if from
so humble a scene as the school, we may be permitted to raise our
observations to the senate, it might be hinted, that gentlemen on
each side of the house, while addressing the chair, can with grace
and propriety only make use of one hand; namely, that which is next
to the speaker; and it may be observed in passing, that to all the
other advantages of speaking, which are supposed to belong to one
side of the house&mdash;may be added&mdash;the graceful use of the
right hand.</p>
<p>The better to conceive the position of two speakers in a scene,
a plate is given representing their respective attitudes; and it
must be carefully noted, that when they are not speaking; the arms
must hang in their natural place by the sides; unless what is
spoken by one is of such importance, as to excite agitation and
surprize in the other. But if we should be sparing of gesture at
all times, we should be more particularly so when we are not
speaking.</p>
<p>From what has been laid down, it will evidently appear, how much
more difficult and complicate is the action of a scene than that of
a single speech; and, in teaching both to children, how necessary
it is to adopt as simple and easy a method as possible. The easiest
method of conveying instruction in this point, will be sufficiently
difficult; and therefore, the avoiding of aukwardness and
impropriety should be more the object of instruction, than the
conveying of beauties.</p>
<p>There are indeed some masters who are against teaching boys any
action at all, and are for leading them in this point entirely to
nature. It is happy, however, that they do not leave that action to
nature, which is acquired by dancing; the deportment of their
pupils would soon convince them they were imposed on by the sound
of words. Improved and beautiful nature is the object of the
painter's pencil, the poet's pen, and the rhetorician's action, and
not that sordid and common nature, which is perfectly rude and
uncultivated. Nature directs us to art, and art selects and
polishes the beauties of nature. It is not sufficient for an
orator, says Quintilian, that he is a man: he must be an improved
and cultivated man: he must be a man favoured by nature and
fashioned by art.</p>
<p>But the necessity of adopting some method of teaching action, is
too evident to need proof. Boys will infallibly contract some
action; to require them to stand stock-still while they are
speaking an impassioned speech, is not only exacting a very
difficult task from them, but is, in a great measure, checking
their natural exertions. If they are left to themselves, they will
in all probability fall into very wild and ungraceful action,
which, when once formed into habit, can scarcely ever be corrected:
giving them therefore a general out-line of good action, must be of
the utmost consequence to their progress and improvement in
pronunciation.</p>
<p>The great use, therefore, of a system of action like the
present, is, that a boy will never be embarrassed for want of
knowing what to do with his legs and arms; nor will he bestow that
attention on his action, which ought to be directed to his
pronunciation: he will always be in a position which will not
disgrace his figure; and when this gesture is easy to him, it may
serve as a ground-work to something more perfect: he may either, by
his own genius or his master's instructions, build some other
action upon it, which may in time give it additional force and
variety.</p>
<p>Thus, what seemed either unworthy the attention, or too
difficult for the execution of others, the author of the present
publication hits ventured to attempt. A conviction of the necessity
of leaching some system of action, and the abundant success of the
present system in one of the most respectable academies near
London, has determined him to publish it, for the use of such
seminaries as make English pronunciation a part of their
discipline.</p>
<p>It may not be useless to observe, that boys should be classed in
this, as in every other kind of instruction, according to their
abilities. That a class should not consist of more than ten; that
about eight or ten lines of some speech, should be read first by
the teacher, then by the boy who reads best; and then by the rest
in order, all having a book of the same kind, and all reading the
same portion. This portion they must be ordered to get by heart
against the next lesson; and then the first boy must speak it,
standing at some distance from the rest; in the manner directed in
the plates; the second boy must succeed him, and so on till they
have all spoken. After which another portion may be read to them,
which they must read and speak in the same manner as before. When
they have gone through a speech in this manner by portions, the two
or three first boys may be ordered, against the next lesson, to
speak the whole speech; the next lesson two or three more, and so
on to the rest. This will excite emulation, and give the teacher an
opportunity of ranking them according to their merits.</p>

<h2>SECTION III.</h2>
<h2><i>Rules for expressing with Propriety, the principal Passions
and Humours which occur in Reading or public Speaking</i>.</h2>
<p>Every part of the human frame contributes to express the
passions and emotions of the mind, and to shew, in general, its
present state. The head is sometimes erected, sometimes hung down,
sometimes drawn suddenly back with an air of disdain, sometimes
shews by a nod, a particular person or object; gives assent or
denial, by different motions; threatens by one sort of movement,
approves by another, and expresses suspicion by a third.</p>
<p>The arms are sometimes both thrown out, sometimes the right
alone. Sometimes they are lifted up as high as the face, to express
wonder; sometimes held out before the breast, to shew fear; spread
forth with the hands open to express desire or affection; the hands
clapped in surprise, and in sudden joy and grief; the right hand
clenched, and the arms brandished, to threaten; the two arms set
a-kimbo, to look big, and express contempt or courage. With the
hands, we solicit, we refuse, we promise, we threaten, we dismiss,
we invite, we in treat, we express aversion, fear, doubting,
denial, asking, affirmation, negation, joy, grief, confession,
penitence. With the hands we describe, and point out all
circumstances of time, place and manner of what we relate; we
excite the passions of others, and soothe them: we approve and
disapprove, permit or prohibit, admire or despise. The hands serve
us instead of many sorts of words, and where the language of the
tongue is unknown, that of the hands is understood, being universal
and common to all nations.</p>
<p>The legs advance, or retreat, to express desire, or aversion,
love or hatred, courage or fear, and produce exultation, or leaping
in sudden joy; and the stamping of the foot expresses earnestness,
anger, and threatening.</p>
<p>Especially the face, being furnished with a variety of muscles,
does more in expressing the passions of the mind, than the whole
human frame besides. The change of colour (in white people) shews,
by turns, anger by redness, and sometimes by paleness; fear
likewise by paleness, and shame by blushing. Every feature
contributes its part. The mouth open, shews one state of the mind,
shut, another; the gnashing of the teeth another. The forehead
smooth, eyebrows arched and easy, shew tranquility or joy. Mirth
opens the mouth towards the ears, crisps the nose, half shuts the
eyes, and sometimes fills them with tears. The front wrinkled into
frowns, and the eyebrows overhanging the eyes, like clouds fraught
with tempest, shew a mind agitated with fury. Above all, the eye
shews the very spirit in a visible form. In every different state
of the mind, it assumes a different appearance. Joy brightens and
opens it. Grief half-closes, and drowns it in tears. Hatred and
anger, flash from it like lightning. Love darts from it in glances,
like the orient beam. Jealousy, and squinting envy, dart their
contagious blasts from the eye. And devotion raises it to the
skies, as if the soul of the holy man were going to take its flight
to heaven.</p>
<p>The force of attitude and looks alone appears in a wonderously
striking manner, in the works of the painter and statuary, who have
the delicate art of making the flat canvas and rocky marble utter
every passion of the human mind, and touch the soul of the
spectator, as if the picture, or statue, spoke the pathetic
language of Shakspear. It is no wonder, then, that masterly action,
joined with powerful elocution, should be irresistible. And the
variety of expression, by looks and gestures, is so great, that, as
is well known, a whole play can be represented without a word
spoken.</p>
<p>The following are, I believe, the principal passions, humours,
sentiments and intentions, which are to be expressed by speech and
action. And I hope it will be allowed by the reader, that it is
nearly in the following manner, that nature expresses them.</p>
<p><i><b>Tranquility</b></i>, or <i><b>apathy</b></i>, appears by
the composure of the countenance, and general repose of the body
and limbs, without the exertion of any one muscle. The countenance
open; the forehead smooth; the eyebrows arched; the mouth just not
shut; and the eyes passing with an easy motion from object to
object, but not dwelling long upon any one.</p>
<p><i><b>Cheerfulness</b></i>, adds a smile, opening the mouth a
little more.</p>
<p><i><b>Mirth</b></i>, or <i><b>laughter</b></i>, opens the mouth
still more towards the ears; crisps the nose; lessens the aperture
of the eyes, and sometimes fills them with tears; shakes and
convulses the whole frame, giving considerable pain, which
occasions holding the sides.</p>
<p><i><b>Raillery</b></i>, in sport, without real animosity, puts
on the aspect of cheerfulness. The tone of voice is sprightly. With
contempt, or disgust, it casts a look asquint, from time to time,
at the object; and quits the cheerful aspect for one mixed between
an affected grin and sourness&mdash;the upper lip is drawn up with
an air of disdain. The arms are set a-kimbo on the hips, and the
right hand now and then thrown out toward the object, as if one
were going to strike another a slight back-handed blow. The pitch
of the voice rather loud, the tone arch and sneering; the sentences
short; the expressions satyrical, with mock-praise intermixed.
There are instances of raillery in scripture itself, as 1 Kings
xviii. and Isa. xliv. It is not, therefore, beneath the dignity of
the pulpit-orator, occasionally to use it, in the cause of virtue,
by exhibiting vice in a ludicrus appearance. Nor should I think
raillery unworthy the attention of the lawyer; as it may
occasionally come in, not unusefully, in his pleadings, as well as
any other stroke of ornament, or entertainment.</p>
<p><i><b>Buffoonery</b></i> assumes an arch, sly, leering gravity.
Must not quit its serious aspect, though all should laugh to burst
ribs of steel. This command of face is somewhat difficult, though
not so hard, I should think, as to restrain the contrary sympathy,
I mean of weeping with those who weep.</p>
<p><i><b>Joy</b></i>, when sudden and violent, expresses itself by
clapping of hands, and exultation, or leaping. The eyes are opened
wide; perhaps filled with tears; often raised to heaven, especially
by devout persons. The countenance is smiling; not composedly, but
with features aggravated. The voice rises from time to time, to
very high notes.</p>
<p><i><b>Delight</b></i>, or <i><b>pleasure</b></i>, as when one is
entertained, or ravished with music, painting, oratory, or any such
elegancy, shews itself by the looks, gestures, and utterance of
joy; but moderated.</p>
<p><i><b>Gravity</b></i>, or <i><b>seriousness</b></i>, the mind
fixed upon some important subject, draws down the eyebrows a
little; casts down, or shuts, or raises the eyes to heaven; shuts
the mouth, and pinches the lips close. The posture of the body and
limbs is composed, and without much motion. The speech, if any,
slow and solemn; the tone unvarying.</p>
<p><i><b>Enquiry</b></i> into an obscure subject, fixes the body in
one posture, the head stooping, and the eye poring, the eyebrows
drawn down.</p>
<p><i><b>Attention</b></i> to an esteemed, or superior character,
has the same aspect, and requires silence; the eyes often cast down
upon the ground; sometimes fixed on the face of the speaker; but
not too pertly.</p>
<p><i><b>Modesty</b></i>, or <i><b>submission</b></i>, bends the
body forward; levels the eyes, to the breast, if not to the feet,
of the superior character. The voice low; the tone submissive; and
words few.</p>
<p><i><b>Perplexity</b></i>, or <i><b>anxiety</b></i>, which is
always attended with some degree of fear and uneasiness, draws all
the parts of the body together; gathers up the arms upon the
breast, unless one hand covers the eyes, or rubs the forehead;
draws down the eyebrows; hangs the head upon the breast; casts down
the eyes; shuts and pinches the eye-lids close; shuts the month,
and pinches the lips close, or bites them. Suddenly the whole body
is vehemently agitated. The person walks about busily; stops
abruptly: then he talks to himself, or makes grimaces. If he speaks
to another, his pauses are very long; the tone of his voice,
unvarying, and his sentences broken, expressing half, and keeping
in half of what arises in his mind.</p>
<p><i><b>Vexation</b></i>, occasioned by some real or imaginary
misfortune, agitates the whole frame; and, besides expressing
itself with the looks, gestures, restlessness, and tone of
perplexity, it adds complaint, fretting, and lamenting.</p>
<p><i><b>Pity</b></i>, a mixed passion of love and grief, looks
down upon distress with lifted hands; eyebrows drawn down; mouth
open, and features drawn together. Its expression, as to looks and
gesture, is the same with those of suffering, (see
<i><b>Suffering</b></i>) but more moderate, as the painful feelings
are only sympathetic, and therefore one remove, as it were, more
distant from the soul, than what one feels in his own person.</p>
<p><i><b>Grief</b></i>, sudden and violent, expresses itself by
beating the head; groveling on the ground; tearing of garments,
hair, and flesh; screaming aloud, weeping, stamping with the feet,
lifting the eyes, from time to time, to heaven; hurrying to and
fro, running distracted, or fainting away, sometimes without
recovery. Sometimes violent grief produces a torpid silence,
resembling total apathy.</p>
<p><i><b>Melancholy</b></i>, or fixed grief, is gloomy, sedentary,
motionless. The lower jaw falls; the lips pale; the eyes are cast
down, half shut, eye-lids swelled and red, or livid, tears
trickling silent, and unwiped; with a total inattention to every
thing that passes. Words, if any, few, and those dragged out,
rather than spoken; the accents weak, and interrupted, sighs
breaking into the middle of sentences and words.</p>
<p><i><b>Despair</b></i>, as in a condemned criminal, or one who
has lost all hope of salvation, bends the eyebrows downward; clouds
the forehead; roils the eyes around frightfully; opens the mouth
towards the ears; bites the lips; widens the nostrils; gnashes with
the teeth, like a fierce wild beast. The heart is too much hardened
to suffer tears to flow; yet the eye-balls will be red and
inflamed, like those of an animal in a rabid state. The head is
hung down upon the breast. The arms are bended at the elbows, the
fists are clenched hard; the veins and muscles swelled; the skin
livid; and the whole body strained and violently agitated; groans,
expressive of inward torture, more frequently uttered than words.
If any words, they are few, and expressed with a sullen, eager
bitterness; the tone of voice often loud and furious. As it often
drives people to distraction, and self-murder, it can hardly be
over-acted by one who would represent it.</p>
<p><i><b>Fear</b></i>, violent and sudden, opens very wide the eyes
and mouth; shortens the nose; draws down the eyebrows; gives the
countenance an air of wildness; covers it with a deadly paleness;
draws back the elbows parallel with the sides; lifts up the open
hands, the fingers together, to the height of the breast, so that
the palms face the dreadful object, as shields opposed against it.
One foot is drawn back behind the other, so that the body seems
shrinking from the danger, and putting itself in a posture for
flight. The heart beats violently; the breath is fetched quick and
short; the whole body is thrown into a general tremor. The voice is
weak and trembling; the sentences are short, and the meaning
confused and incoherent. Imminent danger, real or fancied, produces
in timorous persons, as women and children, violent shrieks,
without any articulate sound of words; and sometimes irrecoverably
confounds the understanding; produces fainting, which is sometimes
followed by death.</p>
<p><i><b>Shame</b></i>, or a sense of one's appearing to a
disadvantage, before one's fellow-creatures; turns away the face
from the beholders, covers it with blushes, hangs the head, casts
down the eyes, draws down the eyebrows, either strikes the person
dumb, or, if he attempts to say any thing in his own defence,
causes his tongue to faulter, and confounds his utterance, and puts
him upon making a thousand gestures and grimaces, to keep himself
in countenance; all of which only heighten the confusion of his
appearance.</p>
<p><i><b>Remorse</b></i>, or a painful sense of guilt; casts down
the countenance, and clouds it with anxiety; hangs down the head,
draws the eyebrows down upon the eyes; the right hand beats the
breast; the teeth gnash with anguish; the whole body is strained
and violently agitated. If this strong remorse is succeeded by the
more gracious disposition of penitence, or contrition, then the
eyes are raised (but with great appearance of doubting and fear) to
the throne of heavenly mercy; and immediately cast down again to
the earth. Then floods of tears are seen to flow. The knees are
bended, or the body prostrated on the ground. The arms are spread
in a suppliant posture, and the voice of deprecation is uttered
with sighs, groans, timidity, hesitation and trembling.</p>
<p><i><b>Courage</b></i>, steady, and cool, opens the countenance,
gives the whole form an erect and graceful air. The accents are
strong, full-mouthed and articulate, the voice firm and even.</p>
<p><i><b>Boasting</b></i>, or affected courage, is loud,
blustering, threatening. The eyes stare; the eyebrows draw down;
the face red and bloated; the mouth pouts out; the voice hollow and
thundering; the arms are set a-kimbo; the head often nodding in a
menacing manner; and the right fist, clenched, is brandished, from
time to time, at the person threatened. The right foot is often
stamped upon the ground, and the legs take such large strides, and
the steps are so heavy, that the earth seems to tremble under
them.</p>
<p><i><b>Pride</b></i>, assumes a lofty look, bordering upon the
aspect and attitude of anger. The eyes open, but with the eyebrows
considerably drawn down; the mouth pouting out, mostly shut, and
the lips pinched close. The words walk out a-strut, with a slow,
stiff bombastic affectation of importance. The arms generally
a-kimbo, and the legs at a distance from one another, taking large
tragedy strides.</p>
<p><i><b>Obstinacy</b></i> adds to the aspect of pride, a dodged
sourness, like that of malice. See <i><b>Malice</b></i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Authority</b></i>, opens the countenance, but draws down
the eyebrows a little, so far as to give the look of gravity. See
<i><b>Gravity</b></i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Commanding</b></i> requires an air a little more
peremptory, with a look a little severe or stern. The hand is held
out, and moved toward the person to whom the order is given, with
the palm upwards, and the head nods towards him.</p>
<p><i><b>Forbidding</b></i>, on the contrary, draws the head
backwards, and pushes the hand from one with the palm downward, as
if going to lay it upon the person, to hold him down immoveable,
that he may not do what is forbidden him.</p>
<p><i><b>Affirming</b></i>, especially with a judicial oath, is
expressed by lifting the open right hand and eyes toward heaven; or
if conscience is appealed to, by laying the right hand upon the
breast.</p>
<p><i><b>Denying</b></i> is expressed by pushing the open right
hand from one, and turning the face the contrary way. See
<i>Aversion</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Differing</b></i> in sentiment may be expressed as
refusing. See <i><b>Refusing</b></i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Agreeing</b></i> in opinion, or <i><b>Conviction</b></i>,
as granting. See <i><b>Granting</b></i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Exhorting</b></i>, as by a general at the head of his
army, requires a kind, complacent look; unless matter of offence
has passed, as neglect of duty, or the like.</p>
<p><i><b>Judging</b></i> demands a grave, steady look, with deep
attention; the countenance altogether clear from any appearance of
either disgust or favour. The accents slow, distinct, emphatical,
accompanied with little action, and that very grave.</p>
<p><i><b>Reproving</b></i> puts on a stern aspect, roughens the
voice, and is accompanied with gestures not much different from
those of <i>Threatening</i>, but not so lively.</p>
<p><i><b>Acquitting</b></i> is performed with a benevolent,
tranquil countenance and tone of voice; the right hand, if not
both, open, waved gently toward the person acquitted, expressing
dismission. See <i>Dismissing</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Condemning</b></i> assumes a severe look, but mixed with
pity. The sentence is to be expressed as with reluctance.</p>
<p><i><b>Teaching</b></i>, explaining, inculcating, or giving
orders to an inferior, requires an air of superiority to be
assumed. The features are to be composed of an authoritative
gravity. The eye steady, and open, the eye-brow a little drawn down
over it; but not so much as to look surly or dogmatical. The tone
of voice varying according as the emphasis requires, of which a
good deal is necessary in expressing matter of this sort. The pitch
of the voice to be strong and clear; the articulation distinct; the
utterance slow, and the manner peremptory. This is the proper
manner of pronouncing the commandments in the communion office. But
(I am sorry to say it) they are too commonly spoken in the same
manner as the prayers, than which nothing can be more
unnatural.</p>
<p><i><b>Pardoning</b></i> differs from acquitting, in that the
latter means clearing a person, after trial, of guilt; whereas the
former supposes guilt, and signifies merely delivering the guilty
person from punishment. Pardoning requires some degree of severity
of aspect and tone of voice, because the pardoned person is not an
object of entire unmixed approbation; otherwise its expression is
much the same as granting. See <i><b>Granting</b></i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Arguing</b></i> requires a cool, sedate, attentive aspect,
and a clear, slow, emphatical accent, with much demonstration by
the hand. It differs from teaching (see <i>Teaching</i>) in that
the look of authority is not wanting in arguing.</p>
<p><i><b>Dismissing</b></i>, with approbation, is done with a kind
aspect and tone of voice; the right hand open, gently waved toward
the person. With displeasure, besides the look and tone of voice
which suits displeasure, the hand is hastily thrown out toward the
person dismissed, the back part toward him, the countenance at the
same time turned away from him.</p>
<p><i><b>Refusing</b></i>, when accompanied with displeasure, is
expressed nearly in the same way. Without displeasure, it is done
with a visible reluctance, which occasions the bringing out the
words slowly, with such a shake of the head, and shrug of the
shoulders, as is natural upon hearing of somewhat which gives us
concern.</p>
<p><i><b>Granting</b></i>, when done with unreserved good-will, is
accompanied with a benevolent aspect and tone of voice; the right
hand pressed to the left breast, to signify how heartily the favour
is granted, and the benefactor's joy in conferring it.</p>
<p><i><b>Dependence</b></i>. See <i><b>Modesty</b></i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Veneration</b></i>, or <i><b>Worshipping</b></i>,
comprehends several articles, as ascription, confession, remorse,
intercession, thanksgiving, deprecation, petition, &amp;c.
Ascription of honour and praise to the peerless, supreme Majesty of
Heaven, and confession and deprecation, are to be uttered with all
that humility of looks and gesture, which can exhibit the most
profound self-abasement, and annihilation, before One; whose
superiority is infinite. The head is a little raised, but with the
most apparent timidity and dread; the eye is lifted, but
immediately cast down again, or closed for a moment; the eyebrows
are drawn down in the most respectful manner; the features, and the
whole body and limbs, are all composed to the most profound
gravity; one posture continuing, without considerable change,
during the whole performance of the duty. The knees bended, or the
whole body prostrate, or if the posture be standing, which
scripture does not disallow, bending forward, as ready to prostrate
itself. The arms spread out, but modestly, as high as the breast;
the hands open. The tone of the voice will be submissive, timid,
equal trembling, weak, suppliant. The words will be brought out
with a visible anxiety and diffidence, approaching to hesitation;
few and slow; nothing of vain repetition, haranguing, flowers of
rhetoric, or affected figures of speech; all simplicity, humility,
and lowliness, such as becomes a reptile of the dust, when
presuming to address Him, whose greatness is tremenduous beyond all
created conception. In intercession for our fellow creatures, which
is prescribed in the scriptures, and in thanksgiving, the
countenance will naturally assume a small degree of cheerfulness
beyond what it was clothed with in confession of sin, and
deprecation of punishment. But all affected ornament of speech, or
gesture in devotion, deserves the severest censure, as being
somewhat much worse than absurd.</p>
<p><i><b>Respect</b></i> for a superior, puts on the looks and
gesture of modesty. See <i><b>Modesty</b></i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Hope</b></i> brightens the countenance; arches the
eyebrows; gives the eyes an eager, wishful look; opens the mouth to
half a smile; bends the body a little forward, the feet equal;
spreads the arms, with the hands open, as to receive the object of
its longings. The tone of the voice is eager and unevenly,
inclining to that of joy, but curbed by a degree of doubt and
anxiety. Desire differs from hope as to expression, in this
particular, that there is more appearance of doubt and anxiety in
the former than in the latter. For it is one thing to desire what
is agreeable, and another to have a prospect of actually obtaining
it.</p>
<p><i><b>Desire</b></i> expresses itself by bending the body
forward, and stretching the arms toward the object, as to grasp it.
The countenance smiling, but eager and wishful; the eyes wide open,
and eyebrows raised; the mouth open; the tone of voice suppliant,
but lively and cheerful, unless there be distress as well as
desire; the expressions fluent and copious: if no words are used,
sighs instead of them; but this is chiefly in distress.</p>
<p><i><b>Love</b></i> (successful) lights up the countenance into
smiles. The forehead is smoothed and enlarged; the eyebrows are
arched; the mouth a little open, and smiling; the eyes languishing,
and half shut, doat upon the beloved object. The countenance
assumes the eager and wishful look of desire, (see
<i><b>Desire</b></i> above) but mixed with an air of satisfaction
and repose. The accents are soft and winning; the tone of voice
persuasive, flattering, pathetic, various, musical, rapturous, as
in joy. (See <i><b>Joy</b></i>.) The attitude much the same with
that of desire. Sometimes both hands pressed eagerly to the bosom.
Love, unsuccessful, adds an air of anxiety and melancholy. See
<i><b>Perplexity</b></i> and <i><b>Melancholy</b></i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Giving</b></i>, <i><b>Inviting</b></i>,
<i><b>Soliciting</b></i>. and such-like actions, which suppose some
degree of affection, real or pretended, are accompanied with much
the same looks and gestures as express love, but more moderate.</p>
<p><i><b>Wonder</b></i>, or <i><b>Amazement</b></i>, (without any
other <i>interesting</i> passion, as <i><b>Love</b></i>,
<i><b>Esteem</b></i>, &amp;c.) opens the eyes, and makes them
appear very prominent; sometimes raises them to the skies; but
oftener, and more expressively, fixes them on the object, if the
cause of the passion be a present and visible object, with the
look, all except the wildness, of fear. (See <i><b>Fear</b></i>.)
If the hands hold any thing, at the time when the object of wonder
appears, they immediately let it drop, unconscious, and the whole
body fixes in the contracted, stooping posture of amazement; the
mouth open; the hands held up open, nearly in the attitude of fear.
(See <i><b>Fear</b></i>.) The first excess of this passion stops
all utterance; but it makes amends afterwards by a copious flow of
words, and exclamations.</p>
<p><i><b>Admiration</b></i>, a mixed passion, consisting of wonder,
with love or esteem, takes away the familiar gesture and expression
of simple love. (See <i><b>Love</b></i>.) Keeps the respectful look
and gesture. (See <i><b>Modesty</b></i> and
<i><b>Veneration</b></i>.) The eyes are opened wide, and now and
then raised toward heaven. The mouth is opened. The hands are
lifted up. The tone of the voice rapturous. This passion expresses
itself copiously, making great use of the figure hyperbole.</p>
<p><i><b>Gratitude</b></i> puts on an aspect full of complacency.
(See <i><b>Love</b></i>.) If the object of it is a character
greatly superior, it expresses much submission. (See
<i><b>Modesty</b></i>.) The right hand pressed upon the breast,
accompanies, very properly, the expression of a sincere and hearty
sensibility of obligation.</p>
<p><i><b>Curiosity</b></i>, as of a busy-body, opens the eyes and
mouth, lengthens the neck, bends the body forward, and fixes it in
one posture, with the hands nearly in that of admiration. See
<i><b>Admiration</b></i>. See also <i><b>Desire</b></i>,
<i><b>Attention</b></i>, <i><b>Hope</b></i>, <i><b>Enquiry</b></i>,
and <i><b>Perplexity</b></i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Persuasion</b></i> puts on the looks of moderate love.
(See <i><b>Love</b></i>.) Its accents are soft, flattering,
emphatical and articulate.</p>
<p><i><b>Tempting</b></i>, or <i><b>Wheedling</b></i>, expresses
itself much in the same way, only carrying the fawning part to
excess.</p>
<p><i><b>Promising</b></i> is expressed with benevolent looks, the
nod of consent, and the open hands gently moved towards the person
to whom the promise is made, the palms upwards. The sincerity of
the promiser may be expressed by laying the right hand gently on
the breast.</p>
<p><i><b>Affectation</b></i> displays itself in a thousand
different gestures, motions, airs and looks, according to the
character which the person affects. Affectation of learning gives a
stiff formality to the whole person. The words come stalking out
with the pace of a funeral procession, and every sentence has the
solemnity of an oracle. Affectation of piety turns up the goggling
whites of the eyes to heaven, as if the person were in a trance,
and fixes them in that posture so long that the brain of the
beholder grows giddy. Then comes up, deep grumbling, a holy groan
from the lower parts of the thorax; but so tremendous in sound, and
so long protracted, that you expect to see a goblin rise, like an
exhalation through the solid earth. Then he begins to rock from
side to side, or backward and forward, like an aged pine on the
side of a hill, when a brisk wind blows. The hands are clasped
together, and often lifted, and the head often shaken with foolish
vehemence. The tone of the voice is canting, or sing-song lullaby,
not much distant from an Irish howl, and the words godly doggrell.
Affectation of beauty, and killing, puts a fine woman by turns into
all sorts of forms, appearances and attitudes, but amiable ones.
She undoes by art, or rather by aukwardness, (for true art conceals
itself) all that nature had done for her. Nature formed her almost
an angel, and she, with infinite pains, makes herself a monkey.
Therefore, this species of affectation is easily imitated, or taken
off. Make as many and as ugly grimaces, motions and gestures as can
be made, and take care that nature never peep out, and you
represent coquetish affectation to the life.</p>
<p><i><b>Sloth</b></i> appears by yawning, dosing, snoring; the
head dangling sometimes to one side, sometimes to the other; the
arms and legs stretched out, and every sinew of the body unstrung;
the eyes heavy, or closed; the words, if any, crawl out of the
mouth but half formed, scarcely audible to any ear, and broken off
in the middle by powerful sleep.</p>
<p>People who walk in their sleep (of which our inimitable
Shakespear has, in his tragedy of MACBETH, drawn out a fine scene)
are said to have their eyes open; though they are not, the more for
that, conscious of any thing, but the dream which has got
possession of their imagination. I never saw one of those persons,
therefore cannot describe their manner from nature; but I suppose
their speech is pretty much like that of persons dreaming,
inarticulate, incoherent, and very different, in its tone, from
what it is when waking.</p>
<p><i><b>Intoxication</b></i> shews itself by the eyes half shut,
sleepy, stupid, inflamed. An idiot smile, a ridiculous surliness,
an affected bravado, disgraces the bloated countenance. The mouth
open tumbles out nonsense in heaps, without articulation enough for
any ear to take it in, and unworthy of attention, if it could be
taken In. The head seems too heavy for the neck. The arms dangle
from the shoulders; as if they were almost cut away, and hung by
shreds. The legs totter and bend at the knees, as ready to sink
under the weight of the reeling body. And a general incapacity,
corporeal and mental, exhibits human nature sunk below the
brutal.</p>
<p><i><b>Anger</b></i>, (violent) or <i><b>Rage</b></i> expresses
itself with rapidity, interruption, noise, harshness, and
trepidation. The neck stretched out; the head forward, often
nodding and shaken in a menacing manner, against the object of the
passion. The eyes red, inflamed, staring, rolling, and sparkling;
the eyebrows drawn down over them; and the forehead wrinkled into
clouds. The nostrils stretched wide; every vein swelled; every
muscle strained; the breast heaving, and the breath fetched hard.
The mouth open, and drawn on each side toward the ears, shewing the
teeth in a gnashing posture. The face bloated, pale, red, or
sometimes almost black. The feet stamping: the right arm often
thrown out, and menacing with the clenched fist shaken, and a
general end violent agitation of the whole body.</p>
<p><i><b>Peevishism</b></i> or <i><b>Ill-nature</b></i> is a lower
degree of anger; and is therefore expressed in the above manner,
only more moderate, with half sentences, and broken speeches,
uttered hastily; the upper lip drawn up disdainfully; the eyes
asquint upon the object of displeasure.</p>
<p><i><b>Malice</b></i> or <i><b>Spite</b></i>, sets the jaws, or
gnashes with the teeth; sends blasting flashes from the eyes; draws
the mouth toward the ears; clenches both fists, and bends the
elbows in a straining manner. The tone of voice and expression, are
much the same with that of anger; but the pitch not so loud.</p>
<p><i><b>Envy</b></i> is a little more moderate in its gestures
than malice, but much the same in kind.</p>
<p><i><b>Revenge</b></i> expresses itself as malice.</p>
<p><i><b>Cruelty</b></i>. See <i><b>Anger</b></i>,
<i><b>Aversion</b></i>, <i><b>Malice</b></i> and the other
irrascible passions.</p>
<p><i><b>Complaining</b></i> as when one is under violent bodily
pain, distorts the features; almost closes the eyes; sometimes
raises them wishfully; opens the mouth; gnashes with the teeth;
draws up the upper lip; draws down the head upon the breast, and
the whole body together. The arms are violently bent at the elbows,
and the fists strongly clenched. The voice is uttered in groans,
lamentations, and violent screams. Extreme torture produces
fainting, and death.</p>
<p><i><b>Fatigue</b></i> from severe labour, gives a general
languor to the whole body. The countenance is dejected. (See
<i><b>Grief</b></i>.) The arms hang listless; the body (if sitting
or lying along be not the posture) stoops, as in old-age. (See
<i><b>Dotage</b></i>.) The legs, if walking, are dragged heavily
along, and seem at every step ready to bend under the weight of the
body. The voice is weak, and the words hardly enough articulated to
be understood.</p>
<p><i><b>Aversion</b></i>, or <i><b>Hatred</b></i>, expressed to,
or of any person or thing, that is odious to the speaker, occasions
his drawing back, as avoiding the approach of what he hates; the
hands, at the same time, thrown out spread, as if to keep it off.
The face turned away from that side toward which the hands are
thrown out; the eyes looking angrily and asquint the same way the
hands are directed; the eyebrows drawn downwards; the upper lip
disdainfully drawn up; but the teeth set. The pitch of the voice
loud; the tone chiding, unequal, surly, vehement. The sentences
short and abrupt.</p>
<p><i><b>Commendation</b></i>, or <i><b>Approbation</b></i> from a
superior, puts on the aspect of love (excluding desire and respect)
and expresses itself in a mild tone of voice; the arms gently
spread; the palms of the hands toward the person approved.
Exhorting or encouraging, as of an army by a general, is expressed
with some part of the looks and action of courage.</p>
<p><i><b>Jealousy</b></i> would be likely to be well expressed by
one, who had often seen prisoners tortured in the dungeons of the
inquisition, or who had seen what the dungeons of the inquisition
are the best earthly emblem of; I mean Hell. For next to being in
the Pope's or in Satan's prison, is the torture of him who is
possessed with the spirit of jealousy. Being a mixture of passions
directly contrary to one another, the person, whose soul is the
seat of such confusion and tumult, must be in as much greater
misery than Prometheus, with the vulture tearing his liver, as the
pains of the mind are greater than those of the body. Jealousy is a
ferment of love, hatred, hope, fear, shame, anxiety, suspicion,
grief, pity, envy, pride, rage, cruelty, vengeance, madness, and if
there be any other tormenting passion which can agitate the human
mind. Therefore to express jealousy well, requires that one know
how to represent justly all these passions by turns, (see
<i><b>Love</b></i>, <i><b>Hatred</b></i>, &amp;c.) and often
several of them together. Jealousy shews itself by restlessness,
peevishness, thoughtfulness, anxiety, absence of mind. Sometimes it
bursts out in piteous complaint and weeping; then a gleam of hope,
that all is yet well, lights up the countenance into a momentary
smile. Immediately the face, clouded with a general gloom, shews
the mind overcast again with horrid suspicions and frightful
imaginations. Then the arms are folded upon the breast; the fists
violently clenched; the rolling, bloody eyes dart fury. He hurries
to and fro; he has no more rest than a ship in a troubled sea, the
sport of winds and waves. Again, he composes himself a little to
reflect on the charms of the suspected person. She appears to his
imagination like the sweetness of the rising dawn. Then his
monster-breeding fancy represents her as false as she is fair. Then
he roars out as one on the rack, when the cruel engine rends every
joint, and every sinew bursts. Then he throws himself on the
ground. He beats his head against the pavement. Then he springs up,
and with the look and action of a fury bursting hot from the abyss,
he snatches the instrument of death, and, after ripping up the
bosom of the loved, suspected, hated, lamented, fair one, he stabs
himself to the heart, and exhibits a striking proof, how terrible a
creature a puny mortal is, when agitated by an infernal
passion.</p>
<p><i><b>Dotage</b></i> or <i><b>infirm old age</b></i>, shews
itself by talkativeness, boasting of the past, hollowness of the
eyes and cheeks, dimness of sight, deafness, tremor of voice, the
accents, through default of teeth, scarce intelligible; hams weak,
knees tottering, head paralytic, hollow coughing, frequent
expectoration, breathless wheezing, laborious groaning, the body
stooping under the insupportable load of years, which soon shall
crush it into the dust, from whence it had its origin.</p>
<p><i><b>Folly</b></i>, that is, of a natural ideot, gives the face
an habitual thoughtless, brainless grin. The eyes dance from object
to object, without ever fixing steadily upon any one. A thousand
different and incoherent passions, looks, gestures, speeches and
absurdities, are played off every moment.</p>
<p><i><b>Distraction</b></i> opens the eyes to a frightful
wideness, rolls them hastily and wildly from object to object;
distorts every feature; gnashes with the teeth; agitates all parts
of the body; rolls in the dust; foams at the mouth; utters, with
hideous bellowings, execrations, blasphemies, and all that is
fierce and outrageous, rushes furiously on all who approach; and,
if not restrained, tears its own fiesh, and destroys itself.</p>
<p><i><b>Sickness</b></i> has infirmity and feebleness in every
motion and utterance. The eyes dim, and almost closed; cheeks pale
and hollow; the jaw fallen; the head hung down, as if too heavy to
be supported by the neck. A general inertia prevails. The voice
trembling; the utterance through the nose; every sentence
accompanied with a groan; the hand shaking, and the knees tottering
under the body; or the body stretched helpless on the bed.</p>
<p><i><b>Fainting</b></i> produces a sudden relaxation of all that
holds the human frame together, every sinew and ligament unstrung.
The colour flies from the vermilion cheek; the sparkling eye grows
dim. Down the body drops, as helpless, and senseless, as a mass of
clay, to which, by its colour and appearance, it seems hastening to
resolve itself&mdash;Which leads me to conclude with:</p>
<p><i><b>Death</b></i> the awful end of all flesh; which exhibits
nothing in appearance different from what I have been just
describing; for fainting continued ends in death,&mdash;a subject
almost too serious to be made a matter of artificial imitation.</p>
<p><i><b>Lower</b></i> degrees of every passion are to be expressed
by more moderate exertions of voice and gesture; as every public
speaker's discretion will suggest to him.</p>
<p><i><b>Mixed</b></i> passions, or emotions of the mind, require a
mixed expression. <i><b>Pity</b></i>, for example, is composed of
grief and love. It is therefore evident, that a correct speaker
must, by his looks and gestures, and by the tone and pitch of his
voice, express both grief and love, in expressing pity, and so of
the rest.</p>
<p>It is to be remembered, that the action, in expressing the
various humours and passions, for which I have here given rules, is
to be suited to the age, sex, condition, and circumstances of the
character. Violent anger, or rage, for example, is to be expressed
with great agitation; (see <i><b>Anger</b></i>) but the rage of an
infirm old man, of a woman, and of a youth, are all different from
one another, and from that of a man in the flower of his age, as
every speaker's discretion will suggest. A hero may shew fear, or
sensibility of pain; but not in the same manner as a girl would
express those sensations. Grief may be expressed by a person
reading a melancholy story or description of a room. It may be
acted upon the stage. It may be dwelt upon by the pleader at the
bar; or it may have a place in a sermon. The passion is still
grief. But the manner of expressing it will be different in each of
the speakers, if they have judgment.</p>
<p>A correct speaker does not make a movement of limb, or feature,
for which he has not a reason. If he addresses heaven, he looks
upward. If he speaks to his fellow-creatures, he looks round upon
them. The spirit of what he says, or is said to him, appears in his
look. If he expresses amazement, or would excite it, he lifts up
his hands and eyes. If he invites to virtue and happiness, he
spreads his arms, and looks benevolent. If he threatens the
vengeance of heaven against vice, he bends his eye-brow into wrath
and menaces with his arm and countenance. He does not needlessly
saw the air with his arm, nor stab himself with his finger. He does
not clap his right hand upon his breast, unless he has occasion to
speak of himself, or to introduce conscience, or somewhat
sentimental. He does not start back, unless he wants to express
horror or aversion. He does not come forward, but when he has
occasion to solicit. He does not raise his voice, but to express
somewhat peculiarly emphatical. He does not lower it, but to
contrast the raising of it. His eyes, by turns, according to the
humour of the matter he has to express, sparkle fury, brighten into
joy, glance disdain, melt into grief, frown disgust and hatred,
languish into love, or glare distraction.</p>

<a name='On_Reading_and_Speaking' id="On_Reading_and_Speaking"></a>
<h2><i>On Reading and Speaking</i>.</h2>
<h3>FROM BLAIR'S LECTURES.</h3>
<p>The first object of a reader or speaker, is, to be clearly
understood by his hearers. In order for this, it is necessary that
he should pronounce his words distinctly, and deliberately; that he
should carefully avoid the two extremes of uttering either too
fast, or too slow; and that his tone of voice should be perfectly
natural.</p>
<p>A reader or speaker should endeavor to acquire a perfect command
of his voice; so as neither to stun his hearers by pitching it upon
too high a key; nor tire their patience by obliging them to listen
to sounds which are scarcely audible. It is not the loudest
speaker, who is always the best understood; but he who pronounces
upon that key which fills the space occupied by the audience. That
pitch of voice, which is used in ordinary conversation, is usually
the best for a public speaker.</p>
<p>Early attention ought to be paid to the pauses; but the rules
for these are so indefinite and arbitrary, and so difficult to be
comprehended, that long experience is necessary in order to acquire
a perfect knowledge of their use. With regard to the length of the
several pauses, no precise rules can be given. This, together with
the variety of tones which accompany them, depends much upon the
nature of the subject.</p>
<p>Perhaps nothing is of more importance to a reader or speaker,
than a proper attention to accent, emphasis, and cadence. Every
word in our language, of more than one syllable, has, at least, one
accented syllable. This syllable ought to be rightly known, and the
word should be pronounced by the reader or speaker in the same
manner as he would pronounce it in ordinary conversation.</p>
<p>By emphasis, we distinguish those words in a sentence which we
esteem the most important, by laying a greater stress of voice upon
them than we do upon the others. And it is surprising to observe
how the sense of a phrase may be altered by varying the emphasis.
The following example will serve as an illustration.</p>
<p>This short question, "Will you ride to town to-day?" may be
understood in four different ways, and consequently, may receive
four different answers, according to the placing of the
emphasis.</p>
<p>If it be pronounced thus; Will <i>you</i> ride to town to-day?
the answer may properly be, no; I shall send my son. If thus; Will
you <i>ride</i> to town to-day; Answer, no; I intend to walk. Will
you ride to <i>town</i> to-day? No; I shall ride into the country.
Will you ride to town <i>to-day</i>? No; but I shall to-morrow.</p>
<p>This shows how necessary it is that a reader or speaker should
know where to place his emphasis. And the only rule for this is,
that he study to attain a just conception of the force and spirit
of the sentiments which he delivers. There is as great a difference
between one who lays his emphasis properly, and one who pays no
regard to it, or places it wrong, as there is between one who plays
on an instrument with a masterly hand, and the most bungling
performer.</p>
<p>Cadence is the reverse of emphasis. It is a depression or
lowering of the voice; and commonly falls upon the last syllable in
a sentence. It is varied, however, according to the sense. When a
question is asked, it seldom falls upon the last word; and many
sentences require no cadence at all.</p>
<p>In addition to what has been said, it is of great importance to
attend particularly to tones and gestures. To almost every
sentiment we utter, more especially, to every strong emotion,
nature has adapted some peculiar tone of voice. And we may observe,
that every man, when he is much in earnest in common discourse,
when he is speaking on some subject which interests him nearly, has
an eloquent or persuasive tone and manner.</p>
<p>If one were to tell another that he was very angry, or very much
grieved, in a tone which did not suit such emotions, instead of
being believed, he would be laughed at. The best direction which
can be given, is, to copy the proper tones for expressing every
sentiment from those which nature dictates to us in conversation
with others.</p>
<p>With respect to gesture, the few following hints may be of some
service. When speaking in public, one should endeavor to preserve
as much dignity as possible in the whole attitude of the body. An
erect posture is generally to be chosen; standing firm so as to
have the fullest command of all his motions. Any inclination, which
is used, should be forwards towards the hearers, which is a natural
expression of earnestness.</p>
<p>As for the countenance, the chief rule is, that it should
correspond with the nature of the discourse; and when no particular
emotion is expressed, a serious and manly look is always the best.
The eyes should never be fixed close on any one object, but more
easily round upon the whole audience.</p>
<p>In the motions made with the hands consists the chief part of
gesture in speaking. The right hand should be used more frequently
than the left. Warm emotions demand the motion of both hands
corresponding together. All the gestures should be free and easy.
Perpendicular movements with the hands, that is, in a straight line
up and down are seldom good. Oblique motions are, in general, the
most graceful.</p>
<p>Motions made with the hands should proceed rather from the
shoulders than from the elbows; for they appear much more easy. Too
sudden and nimble motions should be avoided. Earnestness can be
fully expressed without them. Above all things, a speaker should
guard against affectation, which is always disgustful.</p>

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
